	abstract = {Pregnant rats were intubated daily throughout gestation with 4.0 or 6.0 g/kg of ethanol. Pair-fed vehicle-treated, and nontreated rats fed ad libitum served as controls. All pups were removed from their biological mothers at birth and were raised by non-drug-treated surrogate mothers. Ethanol treatment reduced food and water consumption and body weight of pregnant animals relative to nontreated controls. Litter weight but not litter size was reduced in alcohol-treated groups. Pups exposed to the lower dosage regimen exhibited postnatal 'catch up' growth, relative to ad libitum controls, but pups from the higher dosage group remained significantly lighter in weight than either their pair-fed controls or ad libitum animals. However, motor activity at 16 and 20 days of age was impaired in both alcohol-treated groups relative to their pair-fed controls. Both alcohol-treated groups also experienced greater postnatal mortality than did pair-fed or ad libitum controls. Since pair-fed animals did not differ from ad libitum controls, and all animals were raised by surrogate mothers, these results cannot be attributed to alcohol-related inhibition of maternal food and water consumption or postnatal maternal factors.},

	abstract = {Maternal smoking during pregnancy increases the likelihood that the offspring will become smokers in adolescence. In the current study, we evaluated effects of prenatal and adolescent nicotine exposure in rats to assess whether there is a biological basis for this relationship. Pregnant rats were given nicotine or vehicle throughout pregnancy and the offspring then again received nicotine or vehicle during adolescence (postnatal days {PN30-47.5)}, using a regimen (6 mg/kg/day by subcutaneous infusion) that produces plasma nicotine levels similar to those in smokers. Evaluations were made in the cerebral cortex and midbrain during adolescent nicotine administration ({PN45)} and for up to 1 month after the end of treatment. We assessed the magnitude and persistence of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ({nAChR)} upregulation; in addition, we evaluated cholinergic synaptic activity by comparing the effects on choline acetyltransferase ({ChAT)}, a constitutive marker for cholinergic nerve terminals, with those on hemicholinium-3 ({HC-3)} binding to the presynaptic choline transporter, which is regulated by nerve impulse activity. Prenatal nicotine exposure had only minor effects on {nAChRs} but produced persistent cholinergic hypoactivity (reduced {HC-3} binding relative to {ChAT)} throughout adolescence and into adulthood ({PN75)}, Adolescent nicotine exposure evoked robust {nAChR} upregulation and also suppressed cholinergic activity. Prenatal nicotine exposure reduced the upregulation of {nAChRs} evoked by adolescent nicotine but worsened the cholinergic hypoactivity during withdrawal. Our results indicate that prenatal nicotine exposure alters the subsequent response to nicotine in adolescence, effects that may contribute to the association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and subsequent adolescent smoking in the offspring.},

	abstract = {During the early postpartum period or following estrogen/progesterone administration, pups elicit maternal behavior accompanied by a robust dopamine ({DA)} response in the nucleus accumbens ({NAC)} of female rats (Afonso et al., 2009). To determine {whetherDAresponds} to ostensibly "salient" stimuli in the absence of consummatory behaviors, we examined {NAC} shell {DA} responses during restricted (stimuli placed in a perforated box), and unrestricted access to pup and food stimuli. Microdialysis samples were collected from female rats that were either cycling and postpartum (Experiment 1), or after ovariectomy and treated with empty and hormone-filled capsules (Experiment 2). Relative to nonprimed controls, hormonally primed females had suppressed basal {DA} concentrations and facilitated pup-{evokedDAresponses}, regardless of stimulus access condition. In contrast, food-evoked {DAresponses} were unchanged by hormonal priming and were greater when females consumed food compared with distal (restricted) exposure to food. During pup and food restriction conditions, the lack of any "appetitive" behavioral differences, even in pup experienced postpartum females, was surprising. In Experiment 3, we confirmed that postpartum dams allocated time equivalently to restricted pup and food stimuli, even after pup deprivation. This was in sharp contrast to the effects of deprivation during the unrestricted access phase. Together, our data demonstrated that, in hormonally primed females, distal pup cues could evoke {DA} responses without prior stimulus experience, ongoing maternal (behavioral) responses, or clear evidence of robust pup saliency. The results suggest that {NAC} {DA} response reflects a state of responsiveness related to basal {DA} suppression in the hormonally primed female rat. © 2013 the authors.},

Uteroplacental blood flow in the diet-restricted rats was 40\% lower than that of the ad libitum-fed rats, before phenoxybenzamine. Phenoxybenzamine caused a 50\% reduction in mean blood pressure in both the ad libitum-fed and diet-restricted rats, but did not alter cardiac output. Phenoxybenzamine decreased preplacental vascular resistance in the diet-restricted rats, resulting in no significant reduction of placental blood flow. In the ad libitum-fed rats, on the other hand, phenyoxybenzamine did not alter preplacental vascular resistance, and placental blood flow decreased 45\% with the fall in blood pressure. Myometrial vascular resistance was unaffected by phenoxybenzamine in either group, and myometrial blood flow decreased with the fall in blood pressure in both groups. Thus, the decreased uteroplacental blood flow associated with diet restriction is the result of increased uteroplacental α-adrenergic vasomotor tone.},

	volume = {145},
	abstract = {The theory of developmental programming suggests that diseases such as the metabolic syndrome may be 'programmed' by exposure to adverse stimuli during early development. The developmental programming literature encompasses the study of a wide range of suboptimal intrauterine environments in a variety of species and correlates these with diverse phenotypic outcomes in the offspring. At a molecular level, a large number of variables have been measured and suggested as the basis of the programmed phenotype. The range of both dependent and independent variables studied often makes the developmental programming literature complex to interpret and the drawing of definitive conclusions difficult. A common, though under-explored, theme of many developmental programming models is a sex difference in offspring outcomes. This holds true across a range of interventions, including dietary, hypoxic, and surgical models. The molecular and phenotypic outcomes of adverse in utero conditions are often more prominent in male than female offspring, although there is little consideration given to the basis for this observation in most studies. We review the evidence that maternal energy investment in male and female conceptuses may not be equal and may be environment dependent. It is suggested that male and female development could be viewed as separate processes from the time of conception, with differences in both timing and outcomes. Reproduction (2013) 145 R1-R13},

	abstract = {This study examines the effects of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ({SSRI)}, fluoxetine ({PROZAC)}, on the ontogeny of spontaneous swimming activity ({SSA)} in developing zebrafish. The development of zebrafish motor behavior consists of four sequential locomotor patterns that develop over 1-5 days post fertilization (dpf), with the final pattern, {SSA}, established at 4-5 dpf In stage specific experiments, larvae were exposed to 4.6 mu M fluoxetine for 24 h periods beginning at 24 h post fertilization (hpf) and extending through 5 dpf From 1-3 dpf, there was no effect on {SSA} or earlier stages of motor development, i.e., spontaneous coiling, evoked coiling and burst swimming. Fluoxetine exposure at 3 dpf for 24 h resulted in a transient decrease in {SSA} through 7 dpf with a complete recovery by 8 dpf. Larvae exposed to 4.6 mu M fluoxetine for 24 h on 4 or 5 dpf showed a significant decrease in {SSA} by day 6 with no recovery through 14 dpf Although {SSA} was significantly affected 24 h after fluoxetine exposure, there was little or no effect on pectoral fin movement. These results demonstrate both a stage specific and a long term effect of 4.6 mu M fluoxetine exposure in 4 and 5 dpf larvae. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ({RT-PCR)} was performed to determine the relative levels of a serotonin transporter protein ({SERT)} transcript and the serotonin {1A} (5-{HT1A)} receptor transcript in developing embryos/larvae over 1-6 dpf. Both transcripts were present at 24 hpf with the relative concentration of {SERT} transcript showing no change over the developmental time range. The relative concentration of the 5-{HT1A} receptor transcript, however, showed a two-tiered pattern of concentration. {RT-PCR} was also used to detect potential changes in the {SERT} and 5-{HT1A} receptor transcripts in 6 dpf larvae after a 24 h exposure to 4.6 mu M fluoxetine on 5 dpf. Three separate regions of the {CNS} were individually analyzed, two defined brain regions and spinal cord. The two brain regions showed no effect on transcript levels subsequent to fluoxetine exposure, however, the spinal cord showed a significant decrease in both transcripts. These results suggest a correlation between decreased concentration of {SERT} and 5-{HT1A} receptor transcripts in spinal cord and decreased {SSA} subsequent to fluoxetine exposure.

	abstract = {A chronic reduction in uterine perfusion pressure in the pregnant rat is associated with significant elevations in mean arterial pressure, proteinuria, and reductions in kidney function as is chronic nitric oxide blockade, suggesting that nitric oxide deficiency may contribute to the clinical manifestations of preeclampsia. The purpose of this study was to determine whether supplementation with L-arginine, the precursor for nitric oxide, attenuates the hypertension produced in response to a chronic reduction in uterine perfusion pressure in the pregnant rat. Reduced uterine perfusion was initiated at day 14 of gestation with arterial pressure determined at day 19 of gestation in conscious, chronically instrumented rats. Arterial pressure was significantly elevated in pregnant rats with chronic reductions in uterine perfusion as compared with pregnant control rats (132±2 versus 109±2 mm Hg, P{\textless}0.01, respectively). Treatment with L-arginine (2\%) in the drinking water was initiated at day 10 of gestation. L-arginine supplementation resulted in a significant decrease in arterial pressure in both pregnant rats with reduced uterine perfusion pressure (113±2 mm Hg treated, P{\textless}0.01 versus untreated pregnant with reduced uterine perfusion pressure) and pregnant control (97±3 mm Hg treated, P{\textless}0.01 versus untreated pregnant) rats. However, supplementation with L-arginine decreased blood pressure by 19 mm Hg in pregnant with reduced uterine perfusion pressure (untreated versus treated) as compared with 12 mm Hg in pregnant (untreated versus treated) rats. Thus, these results suggest that L-arginine supplementation may be beneficial in attenuating the hypertension in preeclampsia.},

	abstract = {Morphological and biomechanical features of the mandible are negatively affected by protein-energy malnutrition, whose effects are apparently dependent on the time of life of application. The aim here was to investigate, in neonatal rats nursed by dams put on a protein-free diet to depress milk production and thus create a state of protein-energy malnutrition in the offspring, subsequent growth and long-term effects by analyzing mandibular dimensions and bone quality in adulthood. Pregnant Wistar rats were fed a 20\% protein diet (control) or a protein-free diet (malnourished) to obtain normal or subnormal milk production, respectively. After weaning, the offspring (males) were fed a 20\% protein diet for 70 days. The dimensions of their excised mandibles were measured directly between anatomical points; the geometry and material quality of mandibular bone were assessed by peripheral quantitative computed tomography. Pups suckling from malnourished dams weighed 49.4\% of those suckling from control dams at weaning; the actual difference between control and malnourished pups was 25.1 g, which persisted until day 91 of age, indicating the absence of catch-up growth. As with body size, the mandibular base length, height and area (an index of mandibular size) were significantly smaller in malnourished than control rats at the end of the study. The mandibular cortical area, volumetric cortical bone mineral content and volumetric cortical bone mineral density assessed by peripheral quantitative computed tomography were similar in both groups of rats at the end of the observation period, but there was a significant reduction in the cortical axial moment of inertia in malnourished rats at this time of postnatal life. These findings suggest that catch-up growth was incomplete in rats malnourished during the suckling period and that the adaptation of mandibular bone architecture to body growth was apparently insufficient to attain normal values, thus not allowing complete compensation in mechanical competence at the end of the study because of an inadequate spatial distribution of resistive material through its cross-section rather than qualitative or quantitative impairment of cortical bone. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract = {Background: The incidence of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders is estimated to be as high as 1 in 100 births. Efforts to better understand the basis of prenatal ethanol-induced impairments in brain functioning, and the mechanisms by which ethanol produces these defects, will rely on the use of animal models of fetal alcohol exposure ({FAE).} Methods: Using a saccharin-sweetened alcohol solution, we developed a free-choice, moderate alcohol access model of prenatal alcohol exposure. Stable drinking of a saccharin solution (0.066\%) was established in female mice. Ethanol then was added to the saccharin in increasing concentrations (2\%, 5\%, 10\% w/v) every 2 days. Water was always available, and mice consumed standard pellet chow. Control mice drank saccharin solution without ethanol. After a stable baseline of ethanol consumption (14 g/kg/day) was obtained, females were impregnated. Ethanol consumption continued throughout pregnancy and then was decreased to 0\% in a step-wise fashion over a period of 6 days after pups were delivered. Characterization of the model included measurements of maternal drinking patterns, blood alcohol levels, food consumption, litter size, pup weight, pup retrieval times for the dams, and effects of {FAE} on performance in fear-conditioned learning and novelty exploration. Results: Maternal food consumption, maternal care, and litter size and number were all found to be similar for the alcohol-exposed and saccharin control animals. {FAE} did not alter locomotor activity in an open field but did increase the time spent inspecting a novel object introduced into the open field. {FAE} mice displayed reduced contextual fear when trained using a delay fear conditioning procedure. Conclusions: The mouse model should be a useful tool in testing hypotheses about the neural mechanisms underlying the learning deficits present in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Moreover, a mouse prenatal ethanol model should increase the opportunity to use the power of genetically defined and genetically altered mouse populations.},

	abstract = {We investigated the impact of low-level resistance to fluoroquinolones on the bactericidal activity of ciprofloxacin in a murine model of urinary tract infection. The susceptible Escherichia coli strain {CFT073} (ciprofloxacin {MIC} [{CIP} {MIC]} of 0.008 μg/ml) was compared to its transconjugants harboring {qnrA1} or {qnrS1} and to an {S83L} {gyrA} mutant. The three derivatives showed similar low-level resistance to fluoroquinolones ({CIP} {MICs}, 0.25 to 0.5 μg/ml). Bactericidal activity measured in vitro after 1, 3, and 6 h of exposure to 0.5 μg/ml of ciprofloxacin was significantly lower for the derivative strains (P {\textless} 0.01). In the murine model of urinary tract infection (at least 45 mice inoculated per strain), mice were treated with a ciprofloxacin regimen of 2.5 mg/kg, given subcutaneously twice daily for 2 days. In mice infected with the susceptible strain, ciprofloxacin significantly decreased viable bacterial counts (log10 {CFU/g} of tissue) in the bladder (4.2 ± 0.5 versus 5.5 ± 1.3; P = 0.001) and in the kidney (3.6 ± 0.8 versus 5.0 ± 1.1; P = 0.003) compared with those of untreated mice. In contrast, no significant decrease in viable bacterial counts was observed with any of the three derivative strains. The area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 {h/MIC} and the maximum concentration of drug in {serum/MIC} ratios measured in plasma were indeed equal to 827 and 147, respectively, for the parental strain, and only 12.4 to 24.8 and 2.2 to 4.4, respectively, for the derivative strains. In conclusion, low-level resistance to fluoroquinolones conferred by a qnr gene is associated with decreased bactericidal activity of ciprofloxacin, similar to that obtained with a {gyrA} mutation.

Control animals were suckled by dams receiving a normal protein diet (16\% protein) during the lactation period and were fed a commercial lab chow diet after weaning. At 70 days, malnourished and control animals were placed on the central platform of the elevated plus-maze facing an enclosed arm and allowed to explore for 5 min. This procedure was repeated at 24-h intervals for 6 days. The repeated testing in the elevated plus-maze did not change the total number of arm entries and attempts to enter open arms, but decreased the percentage of open arm entries, time spent in open arms, and total time spent on the central platform. These data suggest an increase in anxiety with repeated testing in the elevated plus-maze. In addition, the malnourished animals showed a larger number of both rearings and attempts to enter the open arms, suggesting a high level of exploration and/or high impulsiveness of these animals as compared to control. The elevated plus-maze proved to be a useful animal model to evaluate exploratory behaviors in early protein malnourished animals.},

	abstract = {An elevated T-maze was used to study the effects of prenatal protein deficiency on inhibitory avoidance and escape behaviors. Female rats were provided with a 25\% (control) or a 6\% (low protein) casein diets before and during pregnancy. After birth, eight pups in each litter (six males and two females) were fostered to a lactating well-nourished mother. After weaning (21 days of age) all animals received a lab chow diet. Behavioral testing of these offspring began at 70 days of age. To assess inhibitory avoidance, prenatally malnourished and control rats were placed individually at the end of an enclosed arm in an elevated T-maze (one enclosed and two open arms) and the time taken to emerge from this arm was recorded. The same procedure was repeated in 2 subsequent trials given at 30-s intervals. Thirty seconds after the last of these trials, the rat was placed at the end of one open arm and the time taken to withdraw from this arm was measured, thus estimating escape latency. To assess retention, inhibitory avoidance and escape were measured again 72 h later. Prenatally malnourished males and females did not significantly increase avoidance latency from trials 1-3, in contrast to male and female controls. Only control female rats significantly reduced their avoidance latency on the retention test. No significant differences in escape latency were found between diet groups. These results suggest that prenatal malnutrition results in a reduction of anxiety, and that there are gender-specific responses to this test.},

The results showed a significant effect of malnutrition on six behaviors (percent open arm entries, percent time spent in open arms, attempts to enter open arms, rearings, head-dips, and latency to first open arm entry) and a significant diet by session interaction on two behaviors (attempts to enter open arms and head-dips). These results indicate increased exploration of the open arms in prenatally malnourished as compared with well-nourished control rats, suggestive of lower anxiety and/or a higher impulsiveness in these animals.},

A dietary lead intake of 750 ppm by the dams resulted in a mean blood lead concentration in the suckling offspring of about 17 μg/dl. While high-frequency stimulation ({HFS)} of the white matter induced {LTP} of the field potentials in layers {II/III} in cortical slices of ten out of the 14 control rats, only three of the twelve lead-exposed rats showed a small amount of {LTP.} However, in slices from seven of the twelve lead-exposed rats a long-term depression was found following {HFS.} Furthermore, paired-pulse inhibition was weaker in cortical slices from the lead-exposed as compared to the control rats. In the {CA1} hippocampal region the amount of {LTP} was significantly reduced in the lead-exposed group only in slices taken from rats at {PND} 16-20, while no differences were seen in slices from younger animals. It is concluded that even low level lead exposure impairs functions of the visual cortex in the immature rat. We suggest that the developing hippocampus is able to compensate for lead-induced functional deficits in the 2nd postnatal week, being more vulnerable at older ages.},

	abstract = {Oxytocin ({OXT)} that is released centrally is believed to be anxiolytic and have stress-attenuating effects. Oxytocin knockout ({OXTKO)} mice, a genetic model of {OXT} deficiency, have heightened corticosterone release after acute stress and greater anxiety-related behaviour in an elevated plus maze compared to wild-type ({WT)} mice. In the present set of experiments, we recorded the rise in body temperature, referred to as stress-induced hyperthermia ({SIH)}, following transfer to a metabolic cage, which triggers both anxiety and corticosterone release in mice. {SIH} is a marker of activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ({HPA)} axis and sympathetic nervous system. Because corticosterone release after acute stress is typically greater in {OXTKO} than in {WT} mice, we measured {SIH} as a surrogate marker of corticosterone release. Following transfer to a metabolic cage, both {OXTKO} and {WT} mice increased body temperature, but to the same degree. Pregnant mice, which are known to have blunted corticosterone release to acute stress, had attenuated {SIH} after transfer to a metabolic cage compared to cycling mice, but both genotypes manifested the same degree of attenuation. In addition, we tested the effects of the cannabinoid receptor 1 ({CBR1)} antagonist/inverse agonist ({AM251)} upon feeding and {SIH} in {OXTKO} versus {WT} mice. {CBR1} antagonists are known to diminish food intake and to enhance corticosterone both basally and following acute stress. Although {AM251} blunted food intake, the effect was equivalent in both genotypes. The agent did not affect the {SIH} response compared to mice treated with vehicle. {SIH} is excellent for defining anxiolytic or blunted corticosterone responses (such as the stress hyporesponsiveness of pregnancy), but is limited in its ability to detect the heightened corticosterone responses that have been reported in {OXTKO} mice following exposure to psychogenic stress. © 2008 Elsevier {B.V.} All rights reserved.},

In males, the intrauterine malnutrition resulted in impairment of normal weight gain and fat deposition during 1 to 53 d of age, in association with low plasma total triiodothyronine concentration, in spite of normal food intake. In contrast, the intrauterine malnutrition in females led to a marked fat accumulation by 53 d of age with normal food intake, and decreased brown adipose tissue weight, protein content and cytochrome c oxidase activity, indicating a lower sympathetic activity.

	abstract = {Physiological limitations affect an organism's capacity to acquire and expend energy over long periods of activity. These limitations could be related to the central machinery used for acquiring, processing and allocating energy, or by the energy-consuming machinery. Another possibility is that the capacities of central and peripheral organs and tissues are co-adjusted, implying an optimized design. Given the important consequences that rates of energy expenditure have on many ecological aspects of animal life, we need to understand which factors impose ceilings on sustained metabolic rate. Ceilings on sustainable energy expenditure represent the limit below which all the activities performed by an individual must occur. There have been many studies of design constraints on energy budgets, but the different procedures used to identify the type of physiological limitation do not necessarily resolve which factors actually impose metabolic ceilings in small mammals, which precludes a clear understanding of the ecological and evolutionary consequences of design constraints on energy budgets. We propose that the following steps are necessary to identify the physiological limits on sustained metabolic rate: (1) combining peak energy demands to differentiate a central limitation from a peripheral limitation; (2) pushing the animals to their physiological limits (e.g. asymptotic food intake); (3) testing for a central excess capacity (if the limit is set peripherally), or a peripheral excess capacity (if there is a central limitation); (4) utilizing different levels of energy demand to test for symmorphosis.},

	abstract = {The neural mechanisms controlling mate recognition and heterosexual partner preference are sexually differentiated by perinatal actions of sex steroid hormones. We previously showed that the most important action of oestrogen during prenatal development is to defeminise and, to some extent, masculinise brain and behaviour in mice. Female mice deficient in alpha-foetoprotein ({AFP)} due to a targeted mutation in the Afp gene ({AFP-KO)} do not show any female sexual behaviour when paired with an active male because they lack the protective action of {AFP} against maternal oestrogens. In the present study, we investigated whether odour preferences, another sexually differentiated trait in mice, are also defeminised and/or masculinised in {AFP-KO} females due to their prenatal exposure to oestrogens. {AFP-KO} females of two background strains ({CD1} and {C57Bl/6j)} preferred to investigate male over female odours when given the choice between these two odour stimuli in a Y-maze, and thus remained very female-like in this regard. Thus, the absence of lordosis behaviour in these females cannot be explained by a reduced motivation of {AFP-KO} females to investigate male-derived odours. Furthermore, the presence of a strong male-directed odour preference in {AFP-KO} females suggests a postnatal contribution of oestrogens to the development of preferences to investigate opposite-sex odours. © 2007 The Authors.

Retinas were isolated, blood vessels stained with isolectin Griffonia simplicifolia, images of retinal whole-mounts acquired, and the area of vascular obliteration and extent of preretinal neovascularization quantified. This method was compared to the commonly used method of {OIR} quantification in which the number of pre-inner limiting membrane ({ILM)} nuclei is counted in serial sections of whole eyes. To assess the angiostatic activity of T2-{TrpRS}, mice were injected intravitreally at P12 with either T2-{TrpRS}, a {VEGF} aptamer, or vehicle ({PBS)} alone, and the effects on area of obliteration and on preretinal neovascular tuft formation were assessed. {RESULTS.} Using a modified method of quantification in the mouse {OIR} model based on images of isolectin-stained retinal wholemounts, we were able to assess reliably and consistently both vascular obliteration and preretinal neovascular tuft formation in the same specimen. T2-{TrpRS} demonstrated potent angiostatic activity, reducing the appearance of pathologic neovascular tufts by up to 90\%. Surprisingly, T2-{TrpRS} also enhanced physiological revascularization of the obliterated retinal vasculature, reducing these areas by up to 60\% compared with {PBS-injected} eyes. In contrast, the {VEGF} antagonist, while similarly reducing preretinal neovascular tuft formation, did not enhance revascularization of the obliterated areas. {CONCLUSIONS.} Use of a rapid, quantifiable method to assess the effect of T2-{TrpRS} on retinal angiogenesis in the {OIR} model demonstrates the importance of a quantification system that permits simultaneous analysis of a drug's effect on vascular obliteration as well as on preretinal neovascularization. The results obtained using this method suggest enhanced clinical value for compounds such as T2-{TrpRS} that not only inhibit pathologic neovascularization, but also facilitate physiological revascularization of ischemic tissue.

	volume = {56},
	abstract = {Lactation is associated with suppression of reproductive function, the duration of which depends on the number of young suckled and food availability. Although previous studies have documented increasing responsivity to the positive feedback effects of estrogen on luteinizing hormone ({LH)} secretion with time postpartum, changes in the ability of estrogen to stimulate sexual behavior across these time points and the influence of food restriction on response to estrogen have not been investigated. Thus, we compared the ability of exogenous estrogen administration to stimulate proceptive and receptive behavior in ad libitum fed and food restricted rats on Days 15 and 20 postpartum. Because the ability of estrogen to induce sexual behavior depends on activation of both estrogen receptors and estrogen-induced progesterone receptors, a second study compared estrogen and progesterone-it within the {VMH} and {MPOA} in similar groups. Finally, we investigated the role of the high levels of progesterone typical of lactation in the suppression of estrogen-induced sexual behavior by transient blockade of the progesterone receptor using {RU486.} As expected there was an increase across time in the ability of estrogen to stimulate sexual behavior that correlated with an increased ability of estrogen to induce progesterone receptors in the {MPOA} that was most evident in ad libitum fed rats. {RU486} administration concomitant with estrogen administration increased solicitation behavior and was most effective in ad libitum fed rats suggesting an inhibitory role of progesterone on estrogen-induced sexual proceptivity in lactating rats.

	volume = {27},
	abstract = {Synapses need to encode a wide dynamic range of action potential frequencies. Essential vesicle priming proteins of the Munc13 (mammalian Unc13) family play an important role in adapting vesicle supply to variable demand and thus influence short-term plasticity characteristics and synaptic function. Structure-function analyses of Munc13s have identified a "catalytic" C-terminal domain and several N-terminal modulatory domains, including a diacylglycerol/phorbol ester [4 beta-phorbol-12, 13-dibutyrate ({PDBu)]} binding Cl domain. Although still allowing basal priming, a Munc13-1 C1 domain mutation ({H567K)} prevents {PDBu} induced potentiation of evoked transmitter release, leads to strong depression during trains of synaptic activity, and causes perinatal lethality in mice. To understand the mechanism of C1 domain-mediated modulation of Munc13 function, we examined how {PDBu} increases neurotransmitter release. Analyses of osmotically induced release as well as Ca2+ triggered and spontaneous release showed that {PDBu} increases the vesicular release rate without affecting the size of the readily releasable vesicle pool, linking C1 domain activation to a lowering of the energy barrier for vesicle fusion. {PDBu} binding-deficient mutant Munc13-1({H567K)} synapses mirrored the vesicular release properties of {PDBu-potentiated} wild-type synapses, indicating that Munc13-1({H567K)} is a gain-of-function mutant, which conformationally mimics the {PDBu-activated} state of Munc13-1. We propose a {PKC} analogous two-state model of regulation of Munc13s, in which the basal state of Munc13s is disinhibited by C1 domain activation into a state of facilitated vesicle release, regardless of whether the release is spontaneous or action potential triggered.},

Damages occur during winter time when the population density of these species is high and food resources are limited. The forecast of the development of vole populations is needed to prepare countermeasures against vole dam-ages. The increase or decrease of a vole population can be predicted, if the fertility of the caught specimens is observed. The gonadal size of the males was a suitable predictor for the trend of the development of a vole population. The change of population density of the Bank Vole in a time interval of 3 month (September-December) was highly correlated (r = 0.86) with the gonadal index of males. The percentage of pregnant or lactating femals was also a good indicator, but less suitable for practical use. It is assumed, that the hormones of the hypophysis like {FSH}, {LH} and Prolactin rule the growth of the gonads, the fertility and the reproduction in a vole population. Testis size is an indicator for the activity of these fertility hormones and for the reproductive process. It can be used to predict the development of vole populations for a limited time interval.},

	abstract = {Despite an increase of circulatory volume and of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system ({RAAS)} activity, pregnancy is paradoxically accompanied by a decrease in blood pressure. We have reported that the decrease in blood pressure was maintained in pregnant rats despite overactivation of {RAAS} following reduction in sodium intake. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of the opposite condition, e.g., decreased activation of {RAAS} during pregnancy in the rat. To do so, 0.9\% or 1.8\% {NaCl} in drinking water was given to nonpregnant and pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats for 7 days (last week of gestation). Increased sodium intakes (between 10- and 20-fold) produced reduction of plasma renin activity and aldosterone in both nonpregnant and pregnant rats. Systolic blood pressure was not affected in nonpregnant rats. However, in pregnant rats, 0.9\% sodium supplement prevented the decreased blood pressure. Moreover, an increase of systolic blood pressure was obtained in pregnant rats receiving 1.8\% {NaCl.} The 0.9\% sodium supplement did not affect plasma and fetal parameters. However, 1.8\% {NaCl} supplement has larger effects during gestation as shown by increased plasma sodium concentration, hematocrit level, negative water balance, proteinuria, and intrauterine growth restriction. With both sodium supplements, decreased {AT1} {mRNA} levels in the kidney and in the placenta were observed. Our results showed that a high-sodium intake prevents the pregnancy-induced decrease of blood pressure in rats. Nonpregnant rats were able to maintain homeostasis but not the pregnant ones in response to sodium load. Furthermore, pregnant rats on a high-sodium intake (1.8\% {NACl)} showed some physiological responses that resemble manifestations observed in preeclampsia.},

	abstract = {Curcumin can reduce inflammation and neurodegeneration, but its chemical instability and metabolism raise concerns, including whether the more stable metabolite tetrahydrocurcumin ({TC)} may mediate efficacy. We examined the antioxidant, antiinflammatory, or anti-amyloidogenic effects of dietary curcumin and {TC}, either administered chronically to aged Tg2576 {APPsw} mice or acutely to lipopolysaccharide ({LPS)-injected} wild-type mice. Despite dramatically higher drug plasma levels after {TC} compared with curcumin gavage, resulting brain levels of parent compounds were similar, correlating with reduction in {LPSstimulated} inducible nitric-oxide synthase, nitrotyrosine, F2 isoprostanes, and carbonyls. In both the acute ({LPS)} and chronic inflammation (Tg2576), {TC} and curcumin similarly reduced interleukin-1β. Despite these similarities, only curcumin was effective in reducing amyloid plaque burden, insoluble β-amyloid peptide (Aβ), and carbonyls. {TC} had no impact on plaques or insoluble Aβ, but both reduced Tris-buffered saline-soluble Aβ and phospho-c-Jun {NH2-terminal} kinase ({JNK).} Curcumin but not {TC} prevented Aβ aggregation. The {TC} metabolite was detected in brain and plasma from mice chronically fed the parent compound. These data indicate that the dienone bridge present in curcumin, but not in {TC}, is necessary to reduce plaque deposition and protein oxidation in an Alzheimer's model. Nevertheless, {TC} did reduce neuroinflammation and soluble Aβ, effects that may be attributable to limiting {JNK-mediated} transcription. Because of its favorable safety profile and the involvement of misfolded proteins, oxidative damage, and inflammation in multiple chronic degenerative diseases, these data relating curcumin dosing to the blood and tissue levels required for efficacy should help translation efforts from multiple successful preclinical models.},

The mothers were separated from their pups for 3 h per day from postnatal day 1 ({PND-1)} to {PND-10.} To do that, the dams were moved to a different cage and the pups maintained in the original home cage, which was transferred to a different room kept at 32 C. After they reached 120-150 days of age, maternal-deprived and non-deprived animals were either sacrificed for brain acetylcholinesterase measurement, or trained and tested in an object recognition task and in a social recognition task as described by Rossato et al.

The insertion in {SBNH5} was located in the promoter region of an open reading frame, designated {sagA}, rendering it transcriptionally inactive. Protease, streptolysin O, and {DNase} activities and the production of M protein remained the same in the nonhemolytic mutants and the wild-type strains, as did the growth rates and exoprotein profiles. Transconjugants were evaluated in an established murine model by injecting the organisms subcutaneously and monitoring the mice for alterations in weight and the development of necrotic lesions. Animals infected with {SBNH5}, compared to those infected with {MGAS166s}, gained weight during the first 24 h (+1.15 versus -1.16 g; P {\textless} 0.05) and had fewer necrotic lesions (0 versus 7; P = 0.0007). Animals infected with {SB30-2}, compared to those infected with {T18Ps}, also gained weight within the first 24 h (+0.54 versus -0.66 g; P {\textless} 0.05) and produced fewer necrotic lesions (1 versus 8; P = 0.001). Revertants of the mutants in which Tn916 had been excised regained the hemolytic phenotype and the virulence profile of the wild-type strains.

The present experiments determined whether fluctuations in voluntary exercise play a role in these changes in energy balance, as they appear to do in other species. As expected, pregnant hamsters maintained a constant level of food intake and lost 40\% of their body fat. These animals did not show the abrupt decrease in activity after mating that is seen in rats. Instead, they maintained their high, premating level of running wheel activity until the last 3 days of pregnancy. Similarly, ovariectomy and replacement therapy with estradiol or estradiol + progesterone caused substantial changes in energy balance in the absence of significant changes in food intake or running wheel activity. These findings indicate that, unlike rats, Syrian hamsters do not exhibit substantial changes in voluntary exercise during pregnancy or in response to manipulations of ovarian steroid levels. Therefore, neither changes in food intake nor in voluntary exercise play any important role in the pregnancy- or steroid-induced changes in energy balance in Syrian hamsters.},

The root voles studied were daughters whose mothers were stressed by placing cages of these mothers at sites located 200 cm from the cage of the steppe polecat or by restricted food during pregnancy, in term of reduced amount of taking food due to predation stress; in addition, the root voles were daughters which were stressed by predators after weaning. When mothers were stressed by predators during pregnancy, the daughters not only displayed significantly higher amounts of male-typical courtship such as sniff nose, sniff anogential area, trying to explore, opponent, mount and follow, but also delayed the day of vaginal opening and increased the anogenital distance compared to daughters whose mothers were stressed by restricted food or they were not stressed during pregnancy as well as daughters which were stressed after weaning. On the other hand, prenatally stressed daughters significantly decreased sexual attraction for males. These results indicated that predator-induced maternal stress caused a distinct masculinization of female offspring in sexual behavior and body characteristics and sexual attraction. We suggest that the effects are due to the changes of maternal endocrine system induced by stress, and the effects occur only during a critical phase caused sexual differentiation of the female embryonic hypothalamus. We also suggest that the effect of maternal stress on offspring's sexual differentiation may have great significance for population dynamic.},

Enhanced initial and sustained intake of sucrose solution in mice with an oxytocin gene deletion.

Compared to {WT} mice, {OT} {KO} mice consumed significantly greater volumes of saccharin solution during the dark and light photoperiods on the first day and subsequent days of the study.

The present study was performed in order to obtain support for a possible interaction of glucose and oxytocin under physiological conditions. We therefore studied whether or not short-term food deprivation (24 hours) affects basal oxytocin levels in male, female and lactating rats, since this is a situation when glucose is mobilized to prevent hypoglycaemia. Secondly, we studied whether oxytocin levels rise in a situation when blood glucose levels fall, i.e. following i.p. injection of insulin (20 U g-1). In order to explore the role of oxytocin more directly, we investigated whether i.p. injection of the oxytocin antagonist 1-deamino-2-D-Tyr-({OEt)-4-Thr-8-Orn-oxytocin} affects blood glucose levels. Plasma levels of oxytocin, insulin and glucagon were measured with radioimunoassay in samples obtained after decapitation. We found that oxytocin levels were significantly increased following short-term food deprivation in lactating rats. We also found that insulin-induced hypoglycaemia could elevate plasma levels of oxytocin in female and male rats. In addition, administration of an oxytocin antagonist caused a small, but significant decrease in blood glucose levels after 30 min. These data imply that oxytocin may be one of several factors that take part in the control of blood glucose regulation.},

Alveoli were regressed except for some areas of non-collapsed alveoli in pig-/- mice, the volume fractions (median: {plgW+1.5;} {plgW-} 4.3; plg-/-4.7) differed (p0.0011) and was lower in the plg+/- vs. plg+/+ mice at the 0.01 level. Larger ducts surrounded by connective tissue differed (mediin: plg+/+ 2.3; plg+/- 6.4; pig-/- 6.4) among the groups (p=0.0056) significant for plg+/- vs. plg+/+ (p= 0.0488). Finally the volume fractions of the lymph node differed (median: plg+/+3.2; plg+/-2.7; plg-/-17.3) (p= 0.0015) with a dramatic increase in the homozygoteous mice: plg+/- vs. plg-/mice (p=0.0050). Total volume of alveoli (mm3) were different (median: plg+/+ 1.0; plg+/- 8.6; pig-/- 8.9) (p=0.0001), the increase observed comparing plg+/+ vs. plg+/- ({p=O.OOIl).} Likewise total volume of large ducts (median: plg+/+ 3.1; plgt/- 10.9; pig-/- 14.8) differed among the groups (p=0.0005) and significantly so for plg+/- vs. plg+/+ (p=0.0194). Connective tissue and big vessels (median: plg+/t 16.8; plg+/- 25.9; pig-/- 40.5) differed among the groups (p=0.008), with significant increase between plg+/t vs. plg+/- (p=0.030). The h/mph node increased in pig-/- vs. plg+/- (p=0.0326). The data demonstrate altered mammary gland involution in mice deficient for the plasminogen gene indicating a functional role of the plasminogen activation system during this process.},

Treatment with physostigmine reduced the number of avoidances made, and did so similarly for all prenatal treatment groups. Escape latencies were not affected by prenatal treatment, although they were increased by physostigmine administration prior to training. Neither prenatal treatment nor physostigmine treatment affected activity as measured by the number of intertrial crossings while in the apparatus.

A trial ended when the rat remained on the platform for 15 sec, or had been in the tank for 180 sec reaching the platform. Subjects received 5 trials daily for 3 consecutive days, followed by reversal training on Day 4. Groups did not differ in swimming ability. On Day 1 there were no group differences among females in latency to reach the platform or in distance traveled, but male 35 \% {EDC} and 0 \% {EDC} animals had shorter latencies than {LC} controls. On Day 2, latencies and distance traveled of {LC} and 0 \% {EDC} controls decreased while 35 \% {EDC} animals showed no change from Day 1, so that alcohol-exposed rats took longer to reach the platform and traveled a greater distance than controls. On Day 3, 35 \% {EDC} females took longer than controls to reach the platform, and 35 \% {EDC} animals of both sexes traveled a greater distance than controls. Search patterns on the first reversal trial on Day 4 suggest the differences are in spatial processing and not learning per se, but more so in alcohol-exposed males than females. The impaired performance on this task suggests that prenatal alcohol exposure alters the ability to process spatial information.},

	abstract = {The forced swim test ({FST)} is a behavioral test in rodents which was developed in 1978 by Porsolt and colleagues as a model for predicting the clinical efficacy of antidepressant drugs. A modified version of the {FST} added the classification of active behaviors into swimming and climbing, in order to facilitate the differentiation between serotonergic and noradrenergic classes of antidepressant drugs. The {FST} is now widely used in basic research and the pharmaceutical screening of potential antidepressant treatments. It is also one of the most commonly used tests to assess depressive-like behavior in animal models. Despite the simplicity and sensitivity of the {FST} procedure, important differences even in baseline immobility rates have been reported between different groups, which complicate the comparison of results across {studies.In} spite of several methodological papers and reviews published on the {FST}, the need still exists for clarification of factors which can influence the procedure. While most recent reviews have focused on antidepressant effects observed with the {FST}, this one considers the methodological aspects of the procedure, aiming to summarize issues beyond antidepressant action in the {FST.} The previously published literature is analyzed for factors which are known to influence animal behavior in the {FST.} These include biological factors, such as strain, age, body weight, gender and individual differences between animals; influence of preconditioning before the {FST:} handling, social isolation or enriched environment, food manipulations, various kinds of stress, endocrine manipulations and surgery; schedule and routes of treatment, dosage and type of the drugs as well as experimental design and laboratory environmental effects.

	abstract = {There is accumulating data suggesting a neuroprotective activity of cholesterol, especially in stroke and Alzheimer's disease ({AD).} In the present study, a protective activity of this lipid in simulated neonatal anoxia was investigated. Rats were subjected to high cholesterol by feeding their dams with a diet enriched with cholesterol. Half of these rats were subjected to anoxia. One and a half months later, the rats were tested for their ability to acquire a spatial memory, one group on the linear maze and the other on the Morris water maze. After these assessments, the level of total plasma cholesterol was measured. Rats from dams subjected to neonatal anoxia on standard diet performed worse than control rats in both types of behavioral experiments, whereas anoxic rats from dams were housed on hypercholesterolemic diet performed as control animals. It suggests that dietetic cholesterol applied by their dams protected rats against cognitive deficits elicited by neonatal anoxia. Furthermore, offspring of anoxic rats housed on standard diet had elevated levels of blood cholesterol in relation to control animals. Generally, anoxia affected the concentration of this lipid much stronger than hypercholesterolemic diet of their dams. It might mean that the anoxia-related rise of cholesterol could be involved in physiological phenomenon being an adaptive response to neurotoxic processes. This concept is discussed in relation to pathological mechanisms in {AD.} © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	volume = {63},
	abstract = {Background: Methylphenidate ({MPH)} is prescribed for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Exposure to {MPH} before adulthood causes behavioral deficits later in life, including anxiety- and depression-like behaviors and decreased responding to natural and drug rewards. We examined the ability of fluoxetine ({FLX)}, a selective serotonin reuptake blocker, to normalize these {MPH-induced} behavioral deficits. Methods: Male rats received {MPH} (2.0 mg/kg) or saline ({VEH)} during preadolescence (postnatal day [{PD]} 20-35). When adults, rats were divided into groups receiving no treatment, acute or chronic {FLX}, and behavioral reactivity to several emotion-eliciting stimuli were assessed. Results: The {MPH-treated} rats were significantly less responsive to natural (i.e., sucrose) and drug (i.e., morphine) rewards and more sensitive to stress- and anxiety-eliciting situations. These {MPH-induced} deficits were reversed by exposure to {FLX.} Conclusions: These results indicate that exposure to {MPH} during preadolescence leads to behavioral alterations that endure into adulthood and that these behavioral deficits can be normalized by antidepressant treatment. These results highlight the need for further research to better understand the effects of stimulants on the developing nervous system and the potential enduring effects resulting from early-life drug exposure. © 2008 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

Inter-correlations among these measures were nonsignificant, suggesting that the effect of environment on learning cannot be reduced to temperamental factors.

Animals, put under 14 h of light and 10 h of darkness (lights on from 6 to 20 h), were isolated at mating (day 1 of gestation) and assigned from day 8 to one of five groups. Group C was fed ad libitum, and groups {2PF}, {9PF}, {14PF} and {21PF} had food available for three hours per day from 2, 9, 14 and 21 h, respectively. In groups {9PF} and {14PF}, births were clustered in one single period during the night between days 22 and 23 of gestation. In groups C, {2PF} and {21PF}, births were distributed into two periods, during the afternoon of day 22 before darkness and after dawn of day 23. The birth rates of these groups were 55.3, 74.2 and 27.6\%, respectively, on day 22 and 44.7, 25.8 and 72.4\% on day 23. No births occurred during the times that food was available; they were noted in all groups at times when the animals were least active according to records kept throughout gestation. Thus, restricting food availability to periods of normal inactivity (groups {9PF} and {14PF} vs group C) led to a major shift in the time of delivery as well as to a distortion of the normal activity patterns. These results confirm that feeding rhythms are potent entrainers of birth time in rats and that they interact with the light regime. Pregnant rats seem to be organized so that birth either precedes the main daily physical activity or follows it, depending upon the environmental conditions.},

	abstract = {The neuropeptide arginine vasopressin was recently shown to be an important regulator of female social behaviour, including maternal care and aggression. A key brain site for vasopressin-as well as oxytocin-mediated maternal care is the medial preoptic area ({MPOA).} Together with the adjacent bed nucleus of the stria terminalis ({BNST)}, these brain regions are considered to form a 'super-region' for maternal behaviour. In the present study, we investigated the vasopressin and oxytocin systems within the {MPOA} and the {BNST} during maternal care in lactating rats in more detail. Binding to V1a and oxytocin receptors in the {BNST} and to oxytocin receptors in the {MPOA} was increased in lactation. Furthermore, microdialysis revealed that vasopressin release significantly increased ({MPOA)} or tended to increase ({BNST)} during different phases of maternal care (i.e. with or without suckling stimulus). In support, manipulations of V1a receptors in the {MPOA} are known to alter maternal care. We now show that local injection of a selective V1a receptor antagonist bilaterally into the {BNST} did not affect maternal care, but reduced maternal aggression and tended to lower anxiety-related behaviour. The releaseof oxytocin did not change in any of the brain regions during maternal care. The results obtained indicate that locally-released vasopressin within the {MPOA} and the {BNST} is important for the maintenance of complex maternal behaviours, including maternal care and aggression, respectively. © 2010 The Authors.

In previous studies, we reported evidence of enhanced nucleus accumbens ({NAcc)} dopamine ({DA)} function in adult rats subjected to intrauterine anoxia during cesarean (C) section birth. In the present study, we used voltammetry and monoamine-sensitive electrodes to investigate the possibility that this functional hyperactivity of the meso- {NAcc} system is attributable to a loss of inhibitory control from the medial prefrotal cortex ({PFC).} We monitored the {DA} responses to repeated once-daily stress in the right or left {PFC} of adult male rats born vaginally ({VAG)} or by C-section, either with (C + 15) or without (C + 0) an additional 15 min of intrauterine anoxia. In C + 15 animals, we observed a pronounced and persistent blunting of stress-induced {DA} release in the right {PFC} but not in the left; with repeated testing, a similar pattern of dampened right {PFC} {DA} stress responses emerged in C + 0 animals. In addition, C + 15 animals were spontaneously more active than {VAG} and C + 0 animals and displayed an increase in {PFC} {DA} transporter density that was also lateralized to the right hemisphere. There was no evidence, however, that {PFC} D1 and D2 receptor levels differed between birth groups or hemisphere. These findings suggest a mechanism by which perinatal complications involving anoxia might contribute to the etiology of mental disorders that have been linked to disturbances in central {DA} transmission and lateralized {PFC} dysfunction.},

	abstract = {Prenatal ethanol exposure can damage the developing nervous system, producing long-lasting impairments in both brain structure and function. In this study we analyzed how exposure to this teratogen during the period of brain development affects the intracellular redox state in the brain as well as the development of anxiety- and depressive-like phenotypes. Furthermore, we also tested whether aerobic exercise might have therapeutic potential for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders ({FASD)} by increasing neuronal antioxidant capacity and/or by alleviating ethanol-induced behavioral deficits. Sprague-Dawley rats were administered ethanol across all three-trimester equivalents (i.e., throughout gestation and during the first 10 days of postnatal life). Ethanol-exposed and control animals were assigned to either sedentary or running groups at p ostnatal day ({PND)} 48. Runners had free access to a running wheel for 12 days and at {PND} 60 anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors were assessed. Perinatal ethanol exposure resulted in the occurrence of depressive and anxiety-like behaviors in adult rats without affecting their locomotor activity. Voluntary wheel running reversed the depressive-like behaviors in ethanol-exposed males, but not in ethanol-exposed females. Levels of lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation were significantly increased in the hippocampus and cerebellum of ethanol-exposed rats, and there was a concomitant reduction in the levels of the endogenous antioxidant glutathione. Voluntary exercise was able to reverse the deficits in glutathione both in ethanol-exposed males and females. Thus, while voluntary physical exercise increased glutathione levels in both sexes, its effects at the behavioral level were sex dependent, with only ethanol-exposed male runners showing a decrease in depressive-like behaviors.

	abstract = {The neural mechanisms controlling sexual behavior are sexually differentiated by the perinatal actions of sex steroid hormones. We recently observed using female mice deficient in alpha-fetoprotein ({AFP-KO)} and which lack the protective actions of {AFP} against maternal estradiol, that exposure to prenatal estradiol completely defeminized the potential to show lordosis behavior in adulthood. Furthermore, {AFP-KO} females failed to show any male-directed mate preferences following treatment with estradiol and progesterone, indicating a reduced sexual motivation to seek out the male. In the present study, we asked whether neural responses to male-and female-derived odors are also affected in {AFP-KO} female mice. Therefore, we compared patterns of Fos, the protein product of the immediate early gene, c-fos, commonly used as a marker of neuronal activation, between wild-type ({WT)} and {AFP-KO} female mice following exposure to male or estrous female urine. We also tested {WT} males to confirm the previously observed sex differences in neural responses to male urinary odors. Interestingly, {AFP-KO} females showed normal, female-like Fos responses, i.e. exposure to urinary odors from male but not estrous female mice induced equivalent levels of Fos protein in the accessory olfactory pathways (e.g. the medial part of the preoptic nucleus, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the amygdala, and the lateral part of the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus) as well as in the main olfactory pathways (e.g. the piriform cortex and the anterior cortical amygdaloid nucleus), as {WT} females. By contrast, {WT} males did not show any significant induction of Fos protein in these brain areas upon exposure to either male or estrous female urinary odors. These results thus suggest that prenatal estradiol is not involved in the sexual differentiation of neural Fos responses to male-derived odors.},

	abstract = {The effects of the oral administration of imipramine ({IM)} or clomipramine ({CIM)} in adult female rats before pregnancy or during nursing were evaluated. {IM} caused a significant decrease of body weight in both groups of animals and affected the body weight of litters when administered during nursing. {CIM} reduced the increase of weight in the mothers throughout the experiment. Both {IM} and {CIM} decreased water and food intake and locomotor activity of the adult rats. Rats treated during nursing with {IM} showed decreased maternal behavior at various times of treatment. The milk intake of pups from drug-treated mothers also decreased. Pup eye opening was delayed by {CIM} both before pregnancy and during nursing and by {IM} treatment during nursing. Vaginal opening was retarded in female litters from mothers treated during nursing. Open-field behavior showed modifications at 60 days of age in male pups from mothers exposed to {IM} during nursing. Results indicate that the two tricyclic drugs were able to produce general and behavioral modifications in both mothers and their litters. These modifications seem to depend on whether the drug is given before pregnancy or during nursing. Control experiments in dams fed with a restricted diet suggest that the observed alterations in maternal behavior and litter development is not due to the undernourishment caused by drug administration.},

At 90-120 days of age electrographic and behavioral responses to electrical kindling of the medial perforant pathway were investigated in animals from both the straight 25\% diet (designated 25\%/25\% for the pre- and postnatal periods) and the dietary rehabilitated (designated 6\%/25\% casein diet for the pre- and postnatal periods) groups. Animals of the dietary rehabilitated group (6\%/25\%) were found to: (1) require a significantly lower stimulus intensity to evoke afterdischarge activity in the ipsilateral dentate gyrus; (2) progress through the various behavioral stages of kindling in a markedly differrent manner from the 25\%/25\% group, and; (3) require significantly more daily kindling stimulations to attain the full motor convulsive stage indicative of the kindled state. These results indicate that dietary protein rehabilitation at birth is capable of reversing or significantly ameliorating the effects of gestational protein deficiency on susceptibility to seizure activity and acquisition of the kindled state. These findings indicate that gestational protein deficiency results in long-lasting, if not permanent, changes in neuronal systems in the hippocampal formation which are involved in both the electrographic and behavioral correlates of the kindling process.},

	abstract = {There is an enormous demand for new therapeutic interventions for a range of major disorders. The majority of clinical trials in recent years have been unsuccessful despite highly promising preclinical data. Therefore, an urgent issue confronting both the academic and commercial medical research sectors is how to optimize translation of preclinical studies. The vast majority of preclinical studies are currently performed using laboratory mice and rats. We will discuss the various opportunities for optimization of animal models of {CNS} disorders. One limitation of current approaches is that most studies are conducted on sedentary, unstimulated animals with unlimited access to food in the home cage, thus leading to metabolic and physiological compromise. Environmental enrichment, which enhances sensory stimulation, cognitive activity and physical exercise, has been demonstrated to induce dramatic effects on brain and behavior in both wild-type and genetically modified rodent models, relative to standard-housed littermate controls. Environmental enrichment also exerts beneficial effects outside the {CNS}, such as a reduction in excess body fat. We propose that therapeutic interventions which are found to show promise in standard-housed preclinical models should be subsequently tested under conditions of greater environmental enrichment to identify therapeutics which continue to show efficacy in housing contexts of superior 'environmental construct validity'. Other possible approaches to optimize the quality, validity and reporting of preclinical studies in animal models are also discussed.},

In the repeated use of a provisional test battery, we have found that conclusions about the behavioral teratogenic potential of test compounds are most likely to be revealed using tests having intermediate levels of variability. The results obtained from examining animals exposed developmentally to brominated vegetable oil ({BVO} as 2.0, 1.0, 0.5, or 0.25 percent of the diet) and comparisons of the tests' coefficients of variation, offer an empirical example of this concept. Preweaning tests of locomotion and reflex development demonstrated numerous instances of developmental delay in the {BVO-treated} subjects, but postweaning tests revealed few abnormalities. Behavioral testing revealed functional deficits from {BVO} administration at doses lower than those which have adverse effects on reproduction. Examination of the tests' variability by using coefficients of variation as a comparative index, disclosed that the postweaning test variability was almost twice that of the preweaning tests. Thus, the lack of effects of {BVO} on most of the postweaning tests should not be conclusively interpreted as indicative of recovery of function, because this pattern is equally likely to have resulted from the lower sensitivity of these tests. An acceptable standard for future behavioral teratology screening requires a close examination of test variability, as it appears to be an important element in the sensitivity and, hence, the interpretation of such procedures.},

However, the latter showed a clear tendency to an increase in the interphase interval in females and a decrease in males. Prenatal stress increased pain sensitivity in 50\% of rats with prenatal 5-{HT} deficiency and decreased pain sensitivity in the remainder. Increases in pain sensitivity were also seen in control rats (with prenatal injections of physiological saline), though to a significantly lesser extent than in animals with prenatal 5-{HT} depletion. The latter showed gender differences in the effects of prenatal stress on pain sensitivity.

Maternal deprivation stress was examined for its effect on preweanling rat brain {ODC} activity. Ten day old rat pups were removed from the maternal cage, then alternately returned to the mother or placed in a warm environment after the method of Hall. Pups taken from the mother for as little as 1 hour show a significant decline in their whole brain {ODC} activity. The effect peaked at 2-4 hours of deprivation, at which time the brain {ODC} activity was 60\% below that of the equally handled littermate controls. Two hours of deprivation produced a similar effect throughout preweanling development. The effect occurred in all brain regions and also in heart. Return to mother reversed rapidly the deprivation-induced {ODC} decline, with {ODC} activity overshooting to 300\% of control 2 hours after return, then declining to baseline by 4 hours. Putrescine, the immediate product of the {ODC} reaction, declined 15\% one hour after deprivation, and 50\% in brain and heart after 15 hours. These data demonstrate that maternal deprivation alters polyamine metabolism in preweanling rat brain and heart.},

	volume = {58},
	abstract = {We have previously reported that mice with a targeted disruption of their vasopressin 1b receptor gene, Avpr1b, have mild impairments in social recognition and reduced aggression. The reductions in aggression are limited to social forms of aggression, i.e., maternal and inter-male aggression, while predatory aggression remains unaffected. To further clarify the role of the Avpr1b in the regulation of social behavior we first examined anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors in Avpr1b knockout (Avpr1b -/-) mice. We then went on to test the ability of Avpr1b -/- mice to form dominance hierarchies. No major differences were found between Avpr1b -/- and wildtype mice in anxiety-like behaviors, as measured using an elevated plus maze and an open field test, or depression-like behaviors, as measured using a forced swim test. In the social dominance study we found that Avpr1b -/- mice are able to form dominance hierarchies, though in early hierarchy formation dominant Avpr1b -/- mice display significantly more mounting behavior on Day 1 of testing compared to wildtype controls. Further, non-socially dominant Avpr1b -/- mice spend less time engaged in attack behavior than wildtype controls. These findings suggest that while Avpr1b -/- mice may be able to form dominance hierarchies they appear to employ alternate strategies. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

We explored this hypothesis in an animal model of diet-induced obesity ({DIO).} We studied adipose tissue development and glucose tolerance in the offspring of rat dams fed a diet rich in milk and sugar from early adulthood until day (d) 2 postpartum. This diet promoted body weight, ({BW)} gain and was previously shown to produce insulin resistance and gestational glucose intolerance. The {DIO} offspring showed a higher {BW} in early life (between d7 and d35), with a maximum of 1 {SD} above the mean {BW} of controls; however, {BW} in {DIO} offspring after d35 was comparable with that of controls. Neonatal {DIO} offspring also showed larger fat depots, adipocyte hypertrophy (P {\textless}= .001), and more than 2-fold increased tumor necrosis factor alpha messenger {RNA} levels in subcutaneous adipose tissue (P {\textless} .05). In addition, they displayed a higher peak glucose response to a glucose challenge (P {\textless} .05). In postpubertal (d56) and adult (d98) offspring, we found differences in fat mass and distribution and glucose tolerance relating to the offspring's sex but not the maternal diet. In conclusion, {DIO} during pregnancy results in hyperadiposity and reduced glucose tolerance only in their neonatal/weanling but not postpubertal offspring. Future research should disclose whether these early-life effects are reactivated in conditions of heightened insulin resistance. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Mammary tissue of lactating rats has been perfused in situ to measure the effects of insulin and of previous dietary history on utilization of glucose and its incorporation into lipid. This experimental model allows the direct effects of insulin on mammary tissue to be characterized without influence from the secondary consequences of insulin administration that may accompany treatment of the intact animal with this hormone. In mammary tissue from rats starved for 24 h, glucose utilization was stimulated by insulin treatment. The threshold for insulin response was between 0.01 and 0.02 {mU} ml(-1), and no further stimulation took place between 0.02 and 0.04 {mU} ml(-1) insulin. The maximum response was reached within 50 min of the onset of insulin challenge and remained at a plateau value regardless of whether insulin was continuously present or was withdrawn after 15 min. Incorporation of glucose into lipid contributed to this glucose uptake. When no insulin was present in the perfusate, the rate of this process was around 3-fold greater in perfused mammary tissue from fed lactating rats than from those starved for 24 h. Insulin accelerated lipogenesis from glucose approximately 3- and 2-fold, respectively, in these two experimental groups. As for glucose uptake, the role of insulin in the regulation of mammary lipogenesis appeared to be to 'prime' the tissue and commit it to a response that was subsequently insulin independent.},

Rats were undernourished from about birth until either 30 or 60 days of age and then nutritionally rehabilitated for a lengthy period before testing. There were significant differences in the body weight of control and undernourished rats in each experiment. The testing procedure involved rats being placed in a large pool of opaque water. They were required to swim to find a hidden platform located just below the water surface onto which they could escape. Each rat had to perform this test 20 times over a period of 3 days. The time taken and the total distance swum by each rat during each trial was measured. In Experiment 1, rats were familiarised with the water before testing took place, whereas in Experiment 2 they were not. There were no significant differences in the latency to find the platform or the distance swum between well-fed control and previously undernourished rats in either experiment.

Sixteen days and 2 days after infection with H. diminuta and T. spiralis, respectively, 8 rats from each group were switched to intravenous (iv) alimentation, while the remaining animals were retained on oral nutrition as controls. Rats were killed during the following 21 days. The number of T. spiralis recovered from iv fed rats was significantly higher than in controls, whereas the sex ratio and worm size were similar. Disaccharidase deficiencies normally associated with either infection or parenteral feeding were additive in the infected, parenterally nourished rats. The rise in peroxidase activity normally associated with intestinal trichinosis was not as great (P\&lt;0.05) in iv fed rats. Intravenous feeding did not affect tapeworm number, but caused destrobilization. This was followed by secondary proglottization that led to development of worms of normal length and with gravid segments, but with an increased length: weight ratio. Conclusions: oral food deprivation in the host does not adversely affect development of established T. spiralis. The larger worm burden in iv fed rats may be due to reduced inflammation normally involved in worm expulsion. Exogenous food in the gut is not necessary for maintaining established H. diminuta; factors necessary for sustenance and growth can be acquired by the worm entirely from the exocrino enteric circulation.},

Mice fed {DHEA} (0.45\% w/w of food) and mice pair-fed to these mice (food restricted) for 8 weeks were tested for changes in body temperature. {DHEA} was more efficient than food restriction alone in causing hypothermia. {DHEA} injected intraperitoneally also induced hypothermia that reached a nadir at 1 to 2 hr, and slowly recovered by 20 to 24 hr. This effect was dose dependent (0.550 mg). Each mouse strain tested (four) was susceptible to this effect, suggesting that the genetics differ for induction of hypophagia and induction of hypothermia. Because serotonin and dopamine can regulate (decrease) body temperature, we treated mice with haloperidol (dopamine receptor antagonist), 5,7dihydroxytryptamine (serotonin production inhibitor), or ritanserin (serotonin receptor antagonist) prior to injection of {DHEA.} All of these agents increased rather than decreased the hypothermic effects of {DHEA.} {DHEA} metabolites that are proximate (5-androstene-3β, 17β-diol and androstenedione) or further downstream (estradiol-17β) were much less effective than {DHEA} in inducing hypothermia. However, the {DHEA} analog, 16α-chloroepiandrosterone, was as active as {DHEA.} Thus, {DHEA} administered parentally seems to act directly on temperature-regulating sites in the body. These results suggest that {DHEA} induces hypothermia independent of its ability to cause food restriction, to affect serotonin or dopamine functions, or to act via its downstream steroid metabolites.},

	abstract = {Mice with uniparental partial or complete disomies for any one of 11 identified chromosomes show abnormal phenotypes. The abnormalities, or imprinting effects, can be attributable to an incorrect dosage of maternal or paternal copies of imprinted gene(s) located within the regions involved. Here we show that combinations of partial disomies may result in interactions between imprinting effects that seemingly independently affect fetal and/or placental growth in different ways or modify neonatal and postnatal imprinting effects. Candidate genes within the regions have been identified. The findings are generally in accord with the "conflict hypothesis" for the evolution of genomic imprinting but do not clearly demonstrate common growth axes within which imprinted genes may interact. Instead, it would seem that any gene that represses or limits embryonic/fetal growth to the advantage of the mother - by any developmental means - will have been subject to evolutionary selection for paternal allele repression. Likewise, any gene that favors embryonic/fetal development at consequent cost to the mother - by any developmental means - will have faced selection for maternal allele repression. The classical Igf2-Igf2r axis may therefore be unique. The findings involve reinterpretation of older imprinting data and consequently revision of the mouse imprinting map.},

	abstract = {Long-term behavioral habituation ({LTH)}, that is activity decrement upon repeated exposures to spatial novelty, is a relatively simple and ubiquitous form of behavioral plasticity in the animal kingdom, that can be used as a model of nonassociative learning in the freely behaving organism. Several strategies can be followed to tackle upon it. (a) Interference studies pertain to manipulation of the between-exposure interval by a variety of agents of different nature, that are known to interfere with hypothesized ”consolidation process(es)” in associative learning paradigms. This approach indicates that {LTH} is modulated by {NMDA} receptors, requires polysome aggregation and protein synthesis, a functioning neocortex and both slow wave and paradoxical sleep. Further, it is modulated by endogenously released or exogenously given vasopressin and is not affected by blockade of endogenous opioids, at least through the ”mu” receptor type. Moreover, {LTH} is disrupted by bilateral, electrolytic lesion of the locus coeruleus, but it is only impaired by 6-{OH-DA} bilateral lesion of the dorsal noradrenergic bundle, and it is facilitated by electrolytic lesion of the medial septal nuclei. (b) Noninterference correlative studies: Individual differences in behavioral variables can be correlated to some components of the architecture of the hippocampus to reveal structure-function relationships. (c) Noninterference maturation studies pertain to the study of the maturation of {LTH} during postnatal development in a scaled-down Lat-maze in normally reared rats and in rats with deranged rate of body and brain growth by litter size technique, differential stimulation or by perinatal propylthiouracil-induced hypothyroidism. (d) Noninterference development studies pertain to the formation of {LTH} varying the between-exposure interval. It was studied in albino rats of a Sprague-Dawley, random-bred stock ({NRB)} and of the Naples High ({NHE)} and Low-Excitability ({NLE)} lines. The study was carried out during the light or the dark phase of a {12:12LD} cycle, by retesting at different inter-exposure intervals. Multivariate analysis of variance showed significant effects of strain, inter-exposure interval and of postexposure sleep or wakefulness. Furthermore, analysis of the temporal pattern showed the formation of {LTH} to follow a non linear complex function. Further, behavioral habituation consists of emotional and cognitive components that can be separated across different approaches. In conclusion, long-term},

To characterize the neurochemical and neuroanatomical mechanisms that may mediate these behavioral effects in rats, we studied the development [postnatal days ({PD)} 1, 3, 7, 17, 27, 35, 90, and 26 months postnatally] of acetylcholinesterase ({AChE)} activity in hippocampus, neocortex and striatum as a function of prenatal Ch availability. We further measured the density of {AChE-positive} laminae ({PD27} and {PD90)} and interneurons ({PD20)} in the hippocampus as a function of prenatal Ch availability. During {ED11-ED17} pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats received a Ch-deficient, control or Ch-supplemented diet (average Ch intake 0, 1.3 and 4.6 mmol/kg/day, respectively). Prenatal Ch deficiency increased hippocampal {AChE} activity as compared to control animals in both males and females from the 2nd to 5th week postnatally. Moreover, prenatal Ch supplementation reduced hippocampal {AChE} activity as compared to control animals over the same developmental period. There was no effect of prenatal Ch status on either cortical or striatal {AChE} activity at any age measured, and by {PD90} the effect of Ch on hippocampal {AChE} was no longer observed. In order to localize the early changes in hippocampal {AChE} activity anatomically, frozen coronal brain sections ({PD20}, {PD27}, {PD90)} were stained histochemically for {AChE.} Consistent with biochemical results, the {AChE} staining intensity was reduced in {PD27} hippocampal laminae in the Ch-supplemented group and increased in the Ch-deficient group compared to control animals. There was no effect of the diet on hippocampal {AChE} staining intensity on {PD90.} In addition, the prenatal Ch availability was found to alter the size and density of {AChE-positive} {PD20} interneurons.

Surprisingly, mice of the combined {FVII(-/-)TFPI(δ/δ)} genotype were born at the expected mendelian frequency but suffered the fatal perinatal bleeding associated with the {FVII(-/-)} genotype. Mice carrying the {FVII(+/-)/TFPI(δ/δ)} genotype were also rescued from the lethality associated with the {FVII(+/+)/TFPI(δ/δ)} genotype but succumbed to perinatal consumptive coagulopathy. Thus, the rescue of {TFPI(δ/δ)} embryos, either by an accompanying homozygous or heterozygous {FVII} deficiency, suggests that diminishment of {FVII} activity precludes the need for {TFPI-mediated} inhibition of the {FVIIa/tissue} factor coagulation pathway during embryogenesis. Furthermore, the phenotypes of these combined deficiency states suggest that embryonic {FVII} is produced in mice as early as E9.5 and that any level of maternal {FVII} in early-stage embryos is insufficient to cause a coagulopathy in {TFPI(δ/δ)} mice.},

The lack of rescue of {PC(-} /-) embryos and neonates and augmented coagulopathy resulting from an additional heterozygous or homozygous {FVII} deficiency are probably due to increased factor Xa and thrombin generation, resulting from loss of {FVIIa-} dependent tissue factor pathway inhibitor function and the absence of control at the levels of factors Va and {VIIIa.} The presence of fibrin in embryos in the absence of fetal {FVII} suggests that significant clot-generating potential exists outside of the embryonic factor {VII-dependent} pathway.},

Both the diet and drug treatments were administered 20 days prior to and throughout gestation. Of the 12 variables affected by the low-protein diet, 8 were significantly potentiated when undernutrition was combined with cannabis treatment. Some dependent variables that were not altered either by the low-protein diet or by cannabis inhalation were affected by the combination of treatment. These included a lengthened gestation period, an increase in occurrence of stillbirths and litter destruction, and decreased activity in the rat pups. Cannabis coupled with a standard protein diet resulted in a number of developmental indices being delayed but combining the drug with an enriched protein diet ameliorated these effects. The evidence also suggests that the administration of cannabis both before and during gestation resulted in a degree of tolerance to some aspects of the drug effects.},

	abstract = {It is now known that prenatal ethanol ({EtOH)} exposure is associated with impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance in rat offspring, but the underlying mechanism(s) is not known. To test the hypothesis that in vivo insulin signaling through phosphatidylinositol 3 ({PI3)-kinase} is reduced in skeletal muscle of adult rat offspring exposed to {EtOH} in utero, we gave insulin intravenously to these rats and probed steps in the {PI3-kinase} insulin signaling pathway. After insulin treatment, {EtOH-exposed} rats had decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor β-subunit and of insulin receptor substrate-1 ({IRS-1)}, as well as reduced {IRS-1-associated} {PI3-kinase} in the gastrocnemius muscle compared with control rats. There was no significant difference in basal or insulin-stimulated Akt activity between {EtOH-exposed} rats and controls. Insulin-stimulated {PKC} isoform ζ phosphorylation and membrane association were reduced in {EtOH-exposed} rats compared with controls. Muscle insulin binding and peptide contents of insulin receptor, {IRS-1}, p85 subunit of {PI3-kinase}, {Akt/PKB}, and atypical {PKC} isoform ζ were not different between {EtOH-exposed} rats and controls. Thus insulin resistance in rat offspring exposed to {EtOH} in utero may be explained, at least in part, by impaired insulin signaling through the {PI3-kinase} pathway in skeletal muscle.

Prenatal administration of dexamethasone and dietary protein deprivation have demonstrated that there is an increase in transporter abundance for a number of nephron segments but not the subunits of the epithelial sodium channel ({ENaC)} in the cortical collecting duct. Recent studies have shown that aldosterone is elevated in offspring of protein-deprived mothers when studied as adults, but the physiological importance of the increase in serum aldosterone is unknown. As an indirect measure of {ENaC} activity, we compared the natriuretic response to benzamil in offspring of mothers who ate a low-protein diet (6\%) with those who ate a normal diet (20\%) for the last half of pregnancy. The natriuretic response to benzamil was greater in the 6\% group (821.1 ± 161.0 μmol/24 h) compared with the 20\% group (279.1 ± 137.0 μmol/24 h), consistent with greater {ENaC} activity in vivo (P \&lt; 0.05). In this study, we also directly studied cortical collecting tubule function from adult rats using in vitro microperfusion. There was no difference in basal or vasopressinstimulated osmotic water permeability. However, while cortical collecting ducts of adult offspring whose mothers ate a 20\% protein diet had no sodium transport ( -1.9 ± 3.1 pmol·mm -1·min -1), the offspring of rats that ate a 6\% protein diet during the last half of pregnancy had a net sodium flux of 10.7 ± 2.6 pmol·mm -1·min -1 (P = 0.01) in tubules perfused in vitro. Sodium transport was measured using ion-selective electrodes, a novel technique allowing measurement of sodium in nanoliter quantities of fluid. Thus we directly demonstrate that there is prenatal programming of cortical collecting duct sodium transport. © 2012 the American Physiological Society.},

	abstract = {Prenatal ethanol exposure can lead to long-lasting impairments in the ability to process spatial information in rats, as well as produce long-lasting deficits in the ability of animals to exhibit long-term potentiation, a biological model of learning and memory processing. Conversely, we have recently shown that both spatial memory and long-term potentiation can be enhanced in animals that are given access to a running wheel in their home cage. In the present study, Sprague-Dawley rat dams were given one of three diets throughout gestation: (i) a liquid diet containing ethanol (35.5\% ethanol-derived calories); (ii) a liquid diet, isocaloric to the ethanol diet, but with maltose-dextrin substituting for the ethanol derived calories and (iii) an ad libitum diet of standard rat chow. At weaning (28 days) animals were housed individually in either a standard rat cage, or a cage that contained a running wheel. Adult offspring were tested on a two trial version of the Morris water maze beginning at postnatal day 60, for five consecutive days. Following this, the capacity of the perforant path to dentate gyrus pathway to sustain long-term potentiation was examined in these animals using theta-patterned conditioning stimuli. Our results demonstrate that prenatal ethanol exposure can produce pronounced deficits in both spatial memory and long-term potentiation, but that allowing animal's access to voluntary exercise can attenuate these deficits to the point that those exposed to ethanol prenatally can no longer be differentiated from control animals. These findings indicate that voluntary exercise may have therapeutic benefits for individuals that have undergone prenatal ethanol exposure.},

In the present work, adult female rats trained preoperatively to cross a narrow beam for food reward were maintained in standard group cages or an enriched environment, commencing one week after a unilateral lesion. One month post-lesion, half of these rats received multiple suspension grafts of (E20) fetal frontal cortex, placed adjacent to the lesion cavity, and 8 days later recovery of beam-walking skills was examined for a six-week period. The grafts survived in all cases with an appropriate lesion, a notable result given the one month lesion-graft delay, but graft volume was not influenced by postoperative environment. The substantial lesion-induced deficits evident just prior to differential housing showed a marked reduction by the start of post-graft testing, but relative to intact controls a persistent deficit in foot slip errors occurred in all lesion groups. Irrespective of graft status, postoperative enrichment prevented the occurrence of severe foot slips, especially early in retraining. The frontal grafts, however, enhanced beam-walking recovery by reducing the overall frequency of foot slips on early post-grafting sessions, an effect we suggest is related to graft-derived trophic influences, but this measure was not significantly improved by postoperative enrichment.},

	abstract = {Past studies have experienced difficulty in achieving graft survival and behavioural recovery after sensorimotor cortex lesions, In the present work, adult female rats trained preoperatively to cross a narrow beam for food reward were maintained in standard group cages or an enriched environment, commencing one week after a unilateral lesion, One month post-lesion, half of these rats received multiple suspension grafts of (E20) fetal frontal cortex, placed adjacent to the lesion cavity, and 8 days later recovery of beam-walking skills was examined for a six-week period, The grafts survived in all cases with an appropriate lesion, a notable result given the one month lesion-graft delay, but graft volume was not influenced by postoperative environment, The substantial lesion-induced deficits evident just prior to differential housing showed a marked reduction by the start of post-graft testing, but relative to intact controls a persistent deficit in foot slip errors occurred in all lesion groups, Irrespective of graft status, postoperative enrichment prevented the occurrence of severe foot slips, especially early in retraining, The frontal grafts, however, enhanced beam-walking recovery by reducing the overall frequency of foot slips on early post-grafting sessions, an effect we suggest is related to graft-derived trophic influences, but this measure was not significantly improved by postoperative enrichment.},

	abstract = {Selective deprivation of paradoxical (or rapid eye movements) sleep ({REMS)} in protein malnourished young male rats, results in circadian and homeostatic alterations. By means of electrocorticographic recordings, we have examined the sleep-wake cycle as a functional maturity index, and its circadian and homeostatic mechanisms in prenatal ({PM)} and chronically ({CM)} protein malnourished young male rats. The effects of rapid eye movements sleep-deprivation ({REMS-D)}, by the platform technique in a "conflict experiment" (i.e. recovery from {REMS-D} begun during the circadian phase of activity), revealed that in {PM} animals, wake ({WAK)} was increased significantly during recovery days 1 and 2 ({RD1}, {RD2);} and slow wave sleep ({SWS)} was reduced significantly during these days. Prenatal protein-malnutrition altered the phase of {WAK} and {REMS} rhythms, and the amplitude of {SWS} rhythm was decreased. The {REMS} compensatory increase after {REMS-D} ({REMS} rebound) was confined to the first 4-h block of the activity phase in all experimental groups and 24 h later another {REMS} rebound was displayed in {PM} animals. The paradoxical sleep-rebound in {CM} animals was significantly higher than control and {PM} rats and it was only shown at the first 4-h block after {REMS-D.} Before and after {REMS-D} the circadian distribution of both sleep states, and the electrocortical frequency bands showed different circadian phases at the same day-time in control, {PM} and {CM} rats. The aforementioned indicates that protein malnutrition exerts important effects on the circadian and homeostatic mechanisms driving sleep. Therefore, the temporal structure of the malnourished rats may not allow proper synchronization of some sleep parameters, particularly {REMS}, to the environmental time cues.},

Pregnancy-induced {PPARγ} activation also significantly affected cerebral hemodynamics, decreasing vascular resistance and increasing cerebral blood flow by ∼40\% in response to acute hypertension that caused breakthrough of autoregulation. These structural and hemodynamic changes in the brain during pregnancy were associated with substantially increased blood-brain barrier permeability, an effect that could promote passage of damaging proteins into the brain and cause the neurological complications of eclampsia, including seizure. © 2011 the American Physiological Society.},

	abstract = {The effect of reducing the dietary protein content at different stages of development was investigated. A group of control rats was fed a diet with 25\% protein throughout the entire study. Four other groups were fed only 6\% protein in a diet isocaloric with the control diet. In an "intrauterine"-deprivation (prenatal) group, the feeding of the low protein diet was limited to the span from mating to delivery. In a "postnatal"-deprivation (lactation) group, the reduced protein diet was limited to the 25 days allowed for lactation. In a "perinatal"-deprivation group, the low-protein diet was fed during both the pregnancy and the 25 days after birth. Protein deprivation in a "preperinatal" group started 1 month before mating and continued throughout gestation and lactation to day 25 after birth. Except for the perinatal group, consisting of two animals, other groups consisted each of three or four rats. Behavioral variables–activity, rest, eating, drinking, exploring, grooming, curling up, and lying down–were studied in rats from each group at 90 days of age for 3 days at consecutive near-12-min intervals for observation spans of 1 min. Two animals subjected to bilateral suprachiasmatic lesions, subsequently validated histologically, and two sham-operated controls were also investigated. Both the population-mean and the single cosinor methods were used for data analysis in conjunction with linear least-squares spectra. Cosinor methods allow the rejection of the zero-amplitude assumption on a group basis for the intact controls (P = 0.007), the intrauterine malnutrition group (P = 0.034), the lactation group (P = 0.059), the preperinatal group (P = 0.055), and on an individualized basis for the two animals constituting the perinatal group (P = 0.007 and 0.002). These results by population-mean cosinor are complemented by the single cosinor demonstration of rhythms for most animals and variables investigated. The results demonstrate, on an individualized basis, the persistence of circadian rhythms under differently timed conditions of protein malnutrition. The data on the behavior of rats with bilateral lesions of the suprachiasmatic nuclei show a circadian to ultradian variance transposition. In most behaviors, there are prominent ultradian rhythms, which, however, require study over longer spans with dense observations on additional animals.},

	abstract = {In an attempt to relate the generalized effect of an acute maternal midgestation fast on fetal growth to specific teratogenic effects of such a treatment, fetal skeletal growth characteristics were observed following a maternal fast on day 8 of gestation in mice. The fasting procedure was found to cause a slight reduction in fetal body weight at day 18 of gestation. The smaller size of fetuses of fasted dams was also evident in skeletal growth parameters of both the axial and appendicular skeleton (length of ossified portion of femur and humerus, transverse length of ossified portion of occipital bone, and distance between parietal bones). Additionally, the level of terminal ossification of vertebrae was less advanced in the fasted groups, as was the stage of sternal and digit development. Skeletal defects observed were less severe than those reported in previous studies of teratogenicity and were found primarily in the skull rather than in the vertebrae and ribs. Severely retarded (or absence of) stainable cartilage or bone in the caudal appendicular skeleton was found in fasted animals more frequently than in comparable controls. The teratogenic effect of a mild-gestation maternal fast may therefore act by preferentially decreasing the growth rate of the most actively growing skeletal elements resulting in disruption of synchrony and the production of anomalies.},

	abstract = {Objective: A simple intervention is needed that could protect the heart against infarction during limited-access coronary artery bypass grafting. Adenosine and norepinephrine can precondition the heart with resulting protection, but adverse hemodynamic effects prevent clinical application. Because heart rate, blood pressure, and contractility effects of these two drugs are diametrically opposite, a mixture might be beneficial. Methods: A superficial branch of the left coronary artery of rabbits was surrounded with a suture. Infarction was produced in all hearts by a 30-minute coronary artery occlusion. Infarct size after reperfusion was measured and is presented as a percentage of the risk zone. The effect of 5-minute intravenous co-infusion of adenosine (20 mg/kg) and norepinephrine (0.1 mg/kg) 15 minutes before ischemia was examined. In addition, the protective effect of three sequential intravenous bolus injections of adenosine at either 0.2 or 0.4 mg/kg was evaluated. Results: Thirty minutes of regional ischemia caused infarction of 40\% +/- 4\% of the risk zone. The combination of adenosine and norepinephrine caused no change in blood pressure but rather protected the heart, with infarction of only 9\% +/- 2\% of the risk zone (p = 0.0001 vs control). Adenosine-norepinephrine co-infusion still protected the heart when the interval between infusion and ischemia was extended to 60 minutes, but it did not protect with a 120-minute interval. Intravenous bolus injections of adenosine resulted in cardiac slowing and marked hypotension. Boluses of 0.2 mg/kg resulted in a minimal, but significant, reduction in infarct size, whereas the higher dose provided no protection. Conclusion: Adenosine-norepinephrine co-infusion provides a feasible and safe parenteral method for preconditioning the heart.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have linked aspartame consumption to impaired retention of learned behavior in rodents. Prenatal exposure to aspartame has also been shown to impair odor-associative learning in guinea pigs; and recently, aspartame-fed hyperlipidemic zebrafish exhibited weight gain, hyperglycemia and acute swimming defects. We therefore investigated the effects of chronic lifetime exposure to aspartame, commencing in utero, on changes in blood glucose parameters, spatial learning and memory in {C57BL/6J} mice. Morris Water Maze ({MWM)} testing was used to assess learning and memory, and a random-fed insulin tolerance test was performed to assess glucose homeostasis. Pearson correlation analysis was used to investigate the associations between body characteristics and {MWM} performance outcome variables. At 17 weeks of age, male aspartame-fed mice exhibited weight gain, elevated fasting glucose levels and decreased insulin sensitivity compared to controls (P\&0.05). Females were less affected, but had significantly raised fasting glucose levels. During spatial learning trials in the {MWM} (acquisition training), the escape latencies of male aspartame-fed mice were consistently higher than controls, indicative of learning impairment. Thigmotactic behavior and time spent floating directionless was increased in aspartame mice, who also spent less time searching in the target quadrant of the maze (P\&0.05). Spatial learning of female aspartame-fed mice was not significantly different from controls. Reference memory during a probe test was affected in both genders, with the aspartame-fed mice spending significantly less time searching for the former location of the platform. Interestingly, the extent of visceral fat deposition correlated positively with non-spatial search strategies such as floating and thigmotaxis, and negatively with time spent in the target quadrant and swimming across the location of the escape platform. These data suggest that lifetime exposure to aspartame, commencing in utero, may affect spatial cognition and glucose homeostasis in {C57BL/6J} mice, particularly in males. © 2012 Collison et al.},

In this study, we investigated metabolic consequences of {PAPP-A} gene deletion and possible relationship to lifespan extension. Specifically, we determined whether 18-month-old {PAPP-A} knockout ({KO)} mice when compared with their {WT} littermates have reduced energy expenditure and/or altered glucose-insulin sensitivity. Food intake, and total energy expenditure and resting energy expenditure as measured by calorimetry were not different between {PAPP-A} {KO} and {WT} mice when subjected to the analysis of covariance with body weight as the covariate. However, there was an increase in spontaneous physical activity in {PAPP-A} {KO} mice. Both {WT} and {PAPP-A} {KO} mice exhibited mild insulin resistance with age, as assessed by fasting glucose/insulin ratios. Oral glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity were not significantly different between the two groups of mice, although there appeared to be a decrease in the average size of the pancreatic islets in {PAPP-A} {KO} mice. Thus, neither reduced 'rate of living' nor altered glucose-insulin homeostasis can be considered key determinants of the enhanced longevity, of {PAPP-A} {KO} mice.

	volume = {5},
	abstract = {Stereotypic behaviour is generally associated with animals maintained in restrictive environments, and has rarely been described in wild or free-ranging animals. The difference between captive and wild populations may be due to their genetic predisposition or to experience of environmental factors. To investigate genetic and environmental factors, we compared the behaviour of 12 wild caught voles and their 9 pups with that of 12 laboratory reared voles and 14 laboratory bred pups. All voles were observed twice. Adults were observed after 10 days housing in a cage, containing food, water, sawdust and hay, and again after 60 days. Pups were observed in the same cages 10 and 60 days after weaning. For each observation, the volas' behaviour was recorded both undisturbed in this cage, and following introduction to an unfamiliar cage. Locomotor stereotypies were observed in laboratory adults, but not in wild caught voles, which spent less time on all locomotor activities and more time under cover than laboratory voles. There was no difference in mortality or fecundity of laboratory and wild caught voles, so there appeared to be no selective advantage to stereotyping. There was no difference in the behaviour of wild and laboratory pups, so early environmental experience of the cage environment, rather than parental background, was an important factor in the development of locomotor stereotypies in this species. Pups that developed stereotypies by 60 days spent lass time under cover and more time walking and climbing after 10 days than voles that did not develop stereotypic behaviour. Stereotypic behaviour may therefore have been derived from persistence of locomotor behaviour. Wild caught voles may have failed to develop locomotor stereotypies, either because they did not perform a locomotor response to captivity or because older voles are less prone to develop novel responses to external cues. It would, therefore, be dangerous to use the absence of stereotypic behaviour as a reliable indicator of welfare without taking into account the animal's prior experience.},

The basal insulinemia and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance ({HOMA-IR)} were lower in the {LO} group than in the other groups. The total area under the insulin curve for the {LO} rats was similar to the {CC} rats, and both were lower than the {CO} and {LC} rats. K§ssub§itt§esub§ was higher in the {LO}, {LC} and {CO} groups than in the {CC} group. Thus, intrauterine protein restriction followed by overfeeding during lactation did not induce obesity, but produced glucose intolerance by impairing pancreatic function in adulthood. © 2013 Coutinho et al.; licensee {BioMed} Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Maternal separation ({MS)} induces depressive-like behavior and long-term changes in cognition in rats. Escitalopram is an antidepressant drug shown to reverse the depressive-like features caused by this stress model. However, it is not known if it can ameliorate the affected cognition. We now characterized the effect of escitalopram on hippocampal-dependent memory in rats submitted to the {MS} protocol. Male Wistar rats were assigned either to control ({CTR)} or maternal separated ({MS)} group. {MS} were separated from their dams between 2-14 postnatal days ({PND)} for 180 min daily. Escitalopram was given in food pellets (0.34 g/kg/day first 2 weeks and 0.41 g/kg/day the subsequent period, average dose 25 mg/kg) from {PND} 43 onwards, during 1 month. Depressive behavior was assessed in the forced swimming test ({FST)}, and memory performance in the Morris water maze ({MWM).} Escitalopram significantly improved the {FST's} latency to despair in the {MS} group (n=6), but did not change the immobility time. All groups showed a significant learning effect in the {MWM} over time, but no differences have been found upon treatment (n=6). However, escitalopram treatment significantly increased the time spent on the platform quadrant in the probe trial in the {MS} group. We report here that chronic treatment with escitalopram is able to improve hippocampal dependent memory in a chronic stress model, while not changing the learning ability. Moreover, this is accompanied by an amelioration of the depressive like behavior. These results support the use of escitalopram to tackle underlying cognitive deficits caused by stress in early-life. © 2012 Elsevier {B.V.} All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Stress during the early postnatal life of laboratory animals can induce body weight gain in adulthood. Exposure of mice to repeated postnatal stress has been shown to increase body weight some weeks after the recording of a hyposensitivity to thermal nociceptive stimulation. Since the increase in nociceptive threshold after repeated environmental manipulations can be interpreted as a behavioral index of stress-induced endogenous opioid release, the present experiment was designed to study whether the stress-induced body weight gain could be prevented by a chronic treatment with the opioid antagonist naloxone. Sixteen litters of {CD-1} male mice were used. Treatments took place from day 2 to day 19 of postnatal life. As well as body weight we measured spontaneous motor activity and food and water consumption. Body length and epididymal fat pad weight were also measured, at the end of the experiment. Stress (i.e. a daily saline injection schedule) increased the rate of body weight gain and the epididymal fat pad weight; a daily injection schedule of naloxone did not induce these effects. No significant differences were evident among groups regarding body length, motor activity, or food and water intake. The data suggest that repeated postnatal saline injections may induce long-term modifications in body and epididymal fat weights and that these effects may be mediated by endogenous opioids.},

The data showed that {PM}, {PCM}, {LLM} and {SM} animals showed lower increases in avoidance latencies, when compared to their control groups. However, malnutrition did not affect escape latencies. The nature of these alterations seems to be nutritional, as the extra-nutritional factors (i.e. maternal care) differ a lot among the malnutrition techniques.

Blood levels of ethanol (mg/100 ml) 180 min after a single dose of 1.5 g/kg, ip, in females, were: virgin (N = 6): 44.9 ± 16.1, pregnant (N = 5): 40.0 ± 10.4, lactant (N = 5): 8.8 ± 5.8. This difference between virgin and pregnant and lactant rats was not related to changes in {ADH} activity which did not differ between groups. The present study indicates that in male rats the effect of a short-term protein deprivation on ethanol elimination is dependent on the age of the animal.

After an oral load of [I-C-14]triolein, virgin rats treated with a supraphysiological dose of insulin over 24 h showed a decrease (58 \%) in ({CO2)-C-14} production and increased accumulation of [C-14]lipid in carcass and white adipose tissue. There was a 2.5-fold increase in lipoprotein lipase activity in the latter. Chronic vanadate administration (12 days) had no effect on these parameters. In lactating rats, the stimulation of the deposition of [C-14]lipid in adipose tissue by exogenous insulin was about 10 \% of that in virgin rats. In prolactin-deficient lactating rats there was no stimulation of [C-14]lipid deposition in adipose tissue by insulin. However, both insulin and vanadate treatment increased the accumulation of [C-14]lipid in mammary gland to the values seen in the mammary glands plus pups of normal lactating rats. Lipoprotein lipase activity in the gland was also restored to normal values. It is concluded that in lactation there is resistance to insulin stimulation of dietary lipid deposition in adipose tissue, and that this is not due to circulating prolactin. In addition, exogenous insulin plays a role in the regulation of lipoprotein lipase and hence of dietary lipid uptake into lactating mammary gland.},

Insulin deficiency decreased mammary-gland total weight (by 40\%), but caused no change in total tissue {DNA.} A greater proportion of the [1-C-14]triolein was oxidized to ({CO2)-C-14} (120 \% increase) in the insulin-deficient rats, and there was a tendency for total transfer of [C-14]lipid to mammary gland and suckling pups to be decreased. A parallel decrease in total mammary-tissue lipoprotein lipase activity occurred. Combined hormone deficiency caused more dramatic changes in all parameters measured. Replacement of insulin (24 h) in insulin-deficient rats decreased ({CO2)-C-14} production, increased the uptake of [C-14]lipid into the mammary gland and tended to increase total lipoprotein lipase activity. In contrast, administration of prolactin to insulin-deficient rats had no effect on any of the parameters measured. Replacement of insulin (24 h) in the combined hormone-deficient rats increased uptake of [C-14]lipid and lipoprotein lipase approx. 3-fold, whereas prolactin again had no significant effects. Replacement of both hormones increased (6-fold) transfer of [C-14]lipid to the pups, but did not increase overall uptake of [C-14]lipid (mammary gland, milk clot and pups) above the value for insulin alone. It is concluded that insulin is the primary regulator of triacylglycerol uptake and of lipoprotein lipase activity in the lactating mammary gland of the rat and that the action of prolactin on these processes is indirect. Prolactin, but not insulin, appears to have a direct effect on milk lipid transfer to pups.},

	volume = {164},
	abstract = {Rationale: Rats reared in social isolation exhibit hyperactivity and specific attentional disturbances in later adult life. These behavioural abnormalities may be relevant to impulsivity and other neuropsychiatric syndromes such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and schizophrenia where disturbances in circuitry involving the prefrontal cortex have been identified. Objective: To establish whether isolation-reared rats show a differential susceptibility to cognitive processes that depend on the prefrontal cortex and its monoaminergic innervation. Methods: Rats were reared in isolation from postnatal day 28 or in social groups of four and trained on the five-choice serial reaction time task, which assesses spatially divided visual attention. Following a range of manipulations designed to tax visual attention and response control, in vivo microdialysis was used in conjunction with behavioural testing to assess dopamine ({DA)} and serotonin (5-{HT)} release in the prefrontal cortex, either under baseline conditions prior to task initiation, or during task performance. Subjects were challenged with amphetamine (0.125 mg/kg intravenously) every 15 min, commencing 15 min after the start of the task. Results: Apart from being consistently slower to collect food rewards and showing more perseverative responses to an auditory distractor, isolates were unimpaired on accuracy, impulsivity and correct latency measures on the five-choice task. Basal levels of {DA} and 5-{HT} in the prefrontal cortex were also unaffected by isolation rearing. Amphetamine increased the speed of responding in control and isolation-reared animals and increased premature (impulsive) responding, but only in socially-reared animals. Cortical {DA} release increased to a similar extent in both groups following amphetamine challenge. By contrast, 5-{HT} release was attenuated in isolates under these conditions. Conclusions: These findings highlight a rather specific deficit in 5-{HT} release in the prefrontal cortex of isolation-reared rats, although this appears not to affect visual attentional function. Rather, these data may be relevant to reduced impulsiveness of isolation-reared rats on the five-choice task. These findings are important in the context of animal models of attentional disturbances in schizophrenia.},

Adolescent (postnatal day ({PND)} 35) and adult ({PND} 70) rats received a single dose of 100 μg/kg {HU210} or 25, 50 or 100 μg/kg {HU210} for 4 or 14 days. Dopamine D1 receptor ({D1R)} or D2 receptor ({D2R)} density was measured in the medial and lateral ({CPUL)} caudate putamen, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle ({TU)} and substantia nigra ({D1R} only) using in vitro autoradiography. {D1R} and {D2R} densities were 1.6-1.7- and 1.1-1.4-fold higher respectively in adolescent control rats compared to adults. In adult rats, {D1R} density was increased by 1.2- and 1.3-fold (p{\textless}0.05) in {CPUL} and {TU} respectively compared to controls, after 14 days of {HU210} treatment. A significant overall effect of treatment (p{\textless}0.05) on {D2R} density was also observed in adults after the single dose and 4 and 14 days administration of {HU210.} In adolescents, an overall effect of treatment on {D1R} density after a single exposure to {HU210} was seen (p= 0.0026) but no changes in {D1R} or {D2R} densities were observed in other treatment groups.

Parental origin of the X did not affect performance of the 5-{CSRTT.} In contrast, the attentional phenotype was rescued in {40,XY*X} mice possessing a single maternally inherited X chromosome and a small {Y*X} chromosome that comprises a complete pseudoautosomal region ({PAR)}, and a small X-specific segment. Conclusions: Our findings are consistent with an X-monosomy effect on attention and suggest the existence of X-linked gene(s) that escape X-inactivation, are present on the small {Y*X} chromosome and impact on attentional functioning; the strongest candidate gene is Sts, encoding steroid sulfatase. The data inform the {TS} literature and indicate novel genetic mechanisms that may be of general significance to the neurobiology of attention. © 2007 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

	abstract = {Adverse experiences early in life may have profound influences on brain development, for example, determining alterations in response to psychostimulant drugs, an increased risk of developing a substance abuse disorder, and individual differences in the vulnerability to neuropsychiatric disorders later in life. Here, we investigated the effects of exposure to an early adverse life event, maternal deprivation, combined with repeated d-amphetamine ({AMPH)} administration in adulthood, on recognition memory and brain-derived neurotrophic factor ({BDNF)} levels in rats' brain and serum. Rats were exposed to one of the following maternal rearing conditions from postnatal days 1 to 14: non-deprived ({ND)} or deprived (D). In adulthood, both groups received injections of saline ({SAL)} or {AMPH} (2.0. mg/kg, i.p.) for 7 days. In Experiment I (performed 24 h after the last {AMPH} injection), {AMPH} induced long-term memory ({LTM)} impairments in {ND} and D groups. The D. +. {AMPH} group also presented short-term memory ({STM)} impairments, indicating that the effects of {AMPH} on memory were more pronounced when the animals where maternally deprived. The group exposed to D. +. {SAL} ({SAL)} showed only {LTM} impairments. In Experiment {II} (performed 8 days after the last injection), {AMPH} detrimental effects on memory persisted in {ND} and D groups. {BDNF} levels were decreased in the hippocampus of D. +. {SAL} rats. In conclusion, {AMPH} produces severe and persistent recognition memory impairments that were more pronounced when the animals were maternally deprived, suggesting that an early adverse life event may increase the vulnerability of cognitive function to exposure to a psychostimulant later in life. © 2011 Elsevier {B.V.}},

	abstract = {Early protein restriction during the prenatal period has significant repercussions on the ontogeny and development of the central nervous system. The present study investigates whether early prenatal protein malnutrition could alter the electrical cerebral activity of the progeny. We used Sprague-Dawley female rats of 200. g randomly divided into three groups: a control group that received a diet with 25\% of the protein content (lactalbumin), the experimental group, that received a diet with 6\% of the protein content and the rehabilitated group that initially received a diet with 6\% of the protein content, then switched to a diet with 25\% of the protein content after the weaning period ({P20D)} up to 60 days of life ({P60D).} Reduction of the protein content from 25\% to 6\% of lactalbumin in the diet of pregnant rats produces impairment in the electrical cerebral activity in the progeny at {P20D} and at {P60D.} The power spectral analysis for each one of the electroencephalograms revealed that prenatal protein malnutrition in rats produced a significant reduction of the alpha (8-13. Hz) and the beta bands (13-30. Hz) and a significant increase of the theta (4-8. Hz), and delta bands (1-4. Hz), at two different stages of life ({P20D} and {P60D).} Similar results were obtained for the rehabilitated group. These results indicate that early malnutrition in life affects the ontogeny of the electrical cerebral activity. This insult probably disrupts the establishment of cortical neural circuits during the critical period of brain development. The rehabilitation period did not revert the impairment in the electrical cerebral activity produced by malnutrition.

At weaning (18.8 +/- 0.44 d) 34 pairs of intrauterine growth restricted ({IUGR)} and normal birth weight sex-matched littermates were selected and fed a starter diet ad libitum until 1 h before sampling at 0, 2, 5, 12 and 28 d postweaning.

The {GSSG:} {GSH} ratio at 5\% of total length was 2-fold higher at day 5 compared to all other days (P {\textless} 0.05), possibly indicating that the mucosal redox balance was disturbed in that time window. The higher {GSH-Px} activity, {GSH} content, and {GSSG:} {GSH} ratio in the proximal {SI} might illustrate the higher need for antioxidant action at that site.

	abstract = {Although the involvement of the {mTOR} (mammalian target of rapamycin) system in memory processes has been reported, information on the effect of rapamycin on spatial learning and memory is limited. It was therefore the aim of the study to show the effect of parenteral rapamycin administration to {C57BL/6J} mice on performance in the multiple T-maze ({MTM)} and to determine hippocampal {mTOR} activity. Rapamycin-treated and -untreated/trained/probed mice are the main part of the experiment considering retrieval and acquisition or consolidation of spatial memory. Six hours following euthanasia hippocampi were extirpated and used for evaluation of {mTOR} activity as represented by hippocampal levels of S6 protein and its phosphorylated active form (phospho S6 protein, 5240,244), a read out of {mTOR} complex 1 activity. Mice given i.p. rapamycin learned the task of the {MTM} but failed at the probe trial, showing absence of the phosphorylated active form of S6 protein, indicating inhibition of {mTOR} activity. Herein, impairing effects of rapamycin on retrieval but not on acquisition or consolidation of spatial memory are shown. Deficient memory retrieval was paralleled by inhibition of {mTOR} complex 1 activity. The current study extends knowledge on rapamycin in memory mechanisms and challenges work on deeper insights into the role of {mTOR} in different phases of memory formation and retrieval.

The offspring of dams treated with {MAM} present alterations of specific neuronal populations whithin the cortex and hippocampus and, when adult, they show impairments in several tests for learning and memory, without major modifications in spontaneous activity. Recent studies have investigated signal transduction mechanisms in microencephalic brains, focussing on phosphorylation processes mediated by the Calcium/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase ({PKC)}, which has been suggested to play a key role in synaptic plasticity and a modification in the phosphorylation state of B-{50/GAP} 43, one of the major {PKC} substrates, has been observed.

	abstract = {Animals subjected to maternal separation stress during the early stages of development display behavioural, endocrine and growth factor abnormalities that mirror the clinical findings in anxiety/depression. In addition, maternal separation has been shown to exacerbate the behavioural deficits induced by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-{OHDA)} in a rat model of Parkinson's disease. In contrast, voluntary exercise reduced the detrimental effects of 6-{OHDA} in the rat model. The beneficial effects of exercise appeared to be largely due to compensation in the non-lesioned hemisphere. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether voluntary exercise for 3 weeks could reverse the effects of maternal separation in rats challenged with the neurotoxin 6-{OHDA} infused into the medial forebrain bundle after 1 week of exercise, at postnatal day 60. The rats were killed 2 weeks later, at postnatal day 74. Their brains were dissected and the hippocampus rapidly removed for proteomic analysis by isobaric tagging ({iTRAQ)} and quantification of peptides by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization tandem mass spectrometry ({MALDI-MS/MS).} Maternal separation upregulated hippocampal proteins functionally involved in energy metabolism (nucleoside diphosphate kinase B, enolase and triosephosphate isomerase) and synaptic plasticity (alpha-synuclein, tenascin-R, Ba1-667, brevican and neurocan core protein) in the non-lesioned hemisphere. Exercise reversed many of these changes by downregulating the levels of hippocampal proteins functionally associated with energy metabolism (nucleoside diphosphate kinase B, enolase and triosephosphate isomerase) and synaptic plasticity (alpha-synuclein, tenascin-R, Ba1-667, brevican and neurocan core protein) in the non-lesioned hemisphere of rats subjected to maternal separation. Exercise and maternal separation therefore appeared to have opposing effects on the hippocampus in the non-lesioned hemisphere of the rat brain. Exercise seemed partly to reverse the effects of maternal separation stress on these proteins in the non-lesioned hemisphere. The partial reversal of maternal separation-induced proteins by exercise in the non-lesioned side sheds some insight into the mechanism by which exercise alters the molecular role players involved in determining the consequences of early life stress.},

The nutritional stress was imposed during the suckling period which is the time when first and second molars are actively mineralizing. Rat dams were fed a low protein (7\%) diet so as to induce a protein calorie deficiency in the suckling pups. Control rats were offered a diet containing 25\% casein. Suckling pups from these groups were then given by intubation either distilled water or isocaloric supplements containing either nonprotein calories or protein. A specific protein deficiency was thus successfully imposed on the suckling pups during this critical period for tooth development. Protein deficiency limited the growth of incisors and molars and delayed eruption, but had no effect on tooth mineral composition. Such tooth changes are of great significance as teeth are not capable of repairing and compensating for these effects which, consequently, may be responsible for the increased caries susceptibility previously demonstrated under the same experimental conditions.},

Escitalopram is an antidepressant drug shown to reverse the depressive-like features caused by this stress model. However, it is not known if it can ameliorate the affected cognition. We now characterized the effect of escitalopram on hippocampal-dependent memory in rats submitted to the {MS} protocol. Male Wistar rats were assigned either to control ({CTR)} or maternal separated ({MS)} group. {MS} were separated from their dams between 2-14 postnatal days ({PHD)} for 180 min daily. Escitalopram was given in food pellets (0.34 g/kg/day first 2 weeks and 0.41 g/kg/day the subsequent period, average dose 25 mg/kg) from {PHD} 43 onwards, during 1 month. Depressive behavior was assessed in the forced swimming test ({FST)}, and memory performance in the Morris water maze ({MWM).} Escitalopram significantly improved the {FST's} latency to despair in the {MS} group (n=6), but did not change the immobility time. All groups showed a significant learning effect in the {MWM} over time, but no differences have been found upon treatment (n=6). However, escitalopram treatment significantly increased the time spent on the platform quadrant in the probe trial in the {MS} group. We report here that chronic treatment with escitalopram is able to improve hippocampal dependent memory in a chronic stress model, while not changing the learning ability. Moreover, this is accompanied by an amelioration of the depressive like behavior. These results support the use of escitalopram to tackle underlying cognitive deficits caused by stress in early-life.

Placental and lactational {PCB} exposure of offspring causes metabolic and endocrine disruptions including hypothyroxinemia, spatial learning and memory deficits, neurochemical and neurobehavioral alterations, and reproductive problems. Previous Studies in our lab using the individual congeners {PCB} 47 (2,2',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl, ortho-substituted) and {PCB} 77 (3,3',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl, non-ortho-substituted) have demonstrated alterations in thyroid hormone levels, alterations in brain choline acetyltransferase ({ChAT)} activity, and spatial learning deficits. In the present study, pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a diet with or without a mixture of {PCB} 47/77 at 1.25 ppm, 12.5 ppm or 25.0 ppm (w/w). Rat pups were swum in the Morris water maze four times a day oil days 21-29 in order for the animals to learn the position of a submerged fixed platform. A probe test was run on day 24 (30 min after last swim) for short-term memory, and on day 29 (24 It after the last swim) for long-term memory after removal of the platform. Time spent in the quadrant previously containing the platform was recorded. Rats were decapitated on day 30, serum collected and frozen at -20degrees. {ChAT} activity was measured radiometrically in basal forebrain and hippocampus. All {PCB-treated} animals experienced a depression in both trijodothyronine (T-3) and thyroxine (T-4). The present study found that all doses of {PCB} depressed {ChAT} activity in hippocampus with no significant alteration in the basal forebrain. In {PCB-treated} animals, short-term memory showed a trend toward improvement and long-term memory toward depression, but these trends were not significant. The consequences likely stem from endocrine disruption, especially with regard to the thyroid. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Hindlimb-suspended mice exhibited reduced skeletal muscle fiber size and enhanced whole-body glucose intolerance, both of which were reversed by chromium treatment. The inhibition of skeletal muscle atrophy by chromium was associated with reductions in the ubiquitination ligase atrogin-1/muscle atrophy F-box, which is elevated in hindlimb-suspended mice. Neither hindlimb suspension nor chromium treatment altered the protein levels of the myostatin, phospho-Forkhead box O-1 and mammalian target of rapamycin. Chromium-treated animals exhibited elevated Akt (Homo sapiens v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog) phosphorylation in their skeletal muscle, with no change observed in the levels of activated {JNK} (c-Jun N-terminal kinase). Thus, these data suggest that nutritional supplementation with chromium may have potential therapeutic benefits in minimizing skeletal muscle atrophy associated with long periods of muscle disuse.

The effects of beta-casomorphin-7 were naloxone-dependent; N-terminal-reduced analogues had a significantly lesser activity. The obtained results testify in favor of the probable role of casein opioid fragments which were formed in mammary glands of a nursing female, in the development of maternal behavior abnormalities.

	volume = {14},
	abstract = {Malnutrition produces changes in the central nervous system ({CNS)} of mammals during development, related to the intensity and timing of the malnutrition insult during the pre- or postnatal period. Protein malnutrition produces irreversible changes in hippocampal formation and some brain stem nuclei. The suprachiasmatic nucleus ({SCN)} is dramatically altered by low-protein diets during the gestational and perinatal periods. Also, it is known that circadian oscillators regulate physiological, behavioral, and cognitive processes and there is evidence that the time-place learning process exhibits a daily temporal distribution. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of chronic, prenatal, or postnatal malnutrition on daily patterns of the time-place learning process in the adult rat. Forty Sprague-Dawley male 90-day-old rats, were divided into four groups: 10 well nourished controls (Co), 10 chronically ({CM)}, 10 prenatally malnourished ({PrM)}, and 10 postnatally malnourished ({PtM)} rats. Efficiency in time-place learning was tested by using a behavioral T-maze. Each rat was assayed for 10 trials before considering the final probe of efficiency. Each trial was 60 seconds long, final efficiency was measured by the amount of time the rat took to reach the end of an arm containing a water pot. Each rat was tested in 2-hour spans until completion of a full 24-hour cycle. A Cosinor analysis was used to evaluate acrophase and percentage of rhythmicity. The obtained results suggest that time-place learning process is influenced by the circadian clock. The severity and timing of prenatal or chronic protein malnutrition modifies the acrophase and rhythmicity of the learning circadian pattern, which can impact important cognitive functions. © {W.S.} Maney \& Son Ltd 2011.},

Presuming that postnatal age and feeding regime set the conditions for either mode of leptin action, we compared the caloric equivalents of changes in fat mass, metabolic rate ({MR)} and food intake ({FI)} induced by 10-day treatments with leptin, in rats treated from postnatal days 7, 15, 25 onward and in adult mice that were free-feeding or food restricted. Whereas {MR} changes are known to dominate from postnatal days 7-16, changes in {MR} explained only about 50\% and 30\% of the leptin-induced changes in fat mass between days 15-24 and days 25-34, respectively. In adult mice of similar body weights, leptin-induced reductions in fat mass under free-feeding conditions were due only to {FI} decreases but due only to {MR} increases under food-restricted conditions. Thus, the same leptin treatment induces the same percentage decrease in body fat content by driving the two effectors differently, depending on age and feeding conditions. Consequently, in assessing the effects of leptin under various physiological conditions, short-term measurements of {FI} or {MR} alone are not sufficient. Instead, determination of the resultant decreases in total body fat is required.},

The usual reproduction parameters were assessed in the dams. The offspring (88-99 per group) were subjected to a routine developmental and behavioral testing battery. After completion of these tests, random samples of the animals were further investigated in four other laboratories using the following techniques: auditory startle habituation, visual discrimination and figure-8 activity monitor; wheel-shaped activity monitor and spatial alternation operant conditioning; two-compartment locomotor activity, passive avoidance and male ultrasonic vocalization during sexual behavior; assays of the weight of different brain areas, their glial fibrillary acidic ({GFA)} protein and S-100 protein concentration. The following dose-dependent effects were noted in ascending dose sensitivity order: delayed vaginal opening; increased and more variable passiveness in spatial alternation; impaired swimming behavior, increased {GFA} protein concentration in the cerebellar vermis; increased auditory startle amplitude, decreased intertrial interval pokes in the visual discrimination test, increased percentage of visits in passive area of figure-8 activity monitor, increased path iteration frequencies and decreased local activity in the wheel-shaped activity monitor, decreased locomotor activity in the two-compartment monitor, increased cerebellar vermis weight, and decreased S-100 protein in the hippocampus.

	abstract = {1 The diverse physiological actions of somatostatin are mediated by a family of G-protein coupled receptors ({SSTRs)}, Several peptide analogues of somatostatin such as octreotide have been developed for therapeutic use, including treatment of gastrointestinal disorders such as secretory diarrhoea. However, their development as anti-diarrhoeal agents has been limited by poor oral bioavailability, necessitating parenteral administration. This in vitro study investigated the antisecretory potential of a group of novel, non-peptide, somatostatin-receptor agonists that selectively activate specific {SSTR} subtypes to assess their potential for oral administration. 2 The ability of the agonists to inhibit forskolin-stimulated chloride secretion was measured using a sensitive bioassay system in isolated rat colonic mucosa. 3 The {SSTR-2} selective agonist, L-779,976 was 10-times more potent than octreotide as an inhibitor of secretion when added to the basolateral surface of rat colon. Non-peptide agonists selective for {SSTR1} (L-797,591), {SSTR3} (L-796,778), {SSTR4} (L-803,087) or {SSTR5} (L-817,818) showed little or no anti-secretory activity in this preparation. 4 L-779,976 was able to inhibit secretion when applied to the luminal surface at sub-micromolar concentrations suggesting that it can cross the colonic epithelium. The anti-secretory potency of luminal L-779,976 was increased 3 fold in the presence of {GF120918}, a known inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. 5 Non-peptide somatostatin receptor agonists may provide a basis for the development of new, orally available anti-diarrhoeal therapies.},

	abstract = {Serotonergic and opiate interactions in the modulation of drug- and environmental-induced analgesia were assessed in 6-day-old Sprague-Dawley-derived rat pups using tail-flick testing procedures. In these experiments the serotonergic antagonist metergoline was observed to attenuate both the analgesia induced by the opiate agonist morphine and the analgesia induced by isolation from siblings and the dam, an environmental manipulation which has previously been shown to be associated with increases in opiate activity. In contrast, the opiate antagonist naloxone was observed to be ineffective in blocking not only analgesia induced by the serotonergic agonist quipazine, but also analgesia induced by long-term deprivation from the dam and food, a manipulation that has been previously reported to induce increases in serotonergic utilization. These results suggest that in the neonate, as in the adult, the serotonergic modulation of nociception appears to occur 'downstream' from the opiate systems serving to regulate nociception following both drug- and environmental-induced alterations in pain sensitivity. Analgesia induced by long-term deprivation from food and the dam appears to be strongly related to increases in serotonergic activity and relatively unaffected by opiate antagonism, whereas analgesia induced by isolation from siblings and the dam may be related to increases in opiate activity, but modulated by serotonergic systems serving to regulate pain responsivity. Thus alterations in the environment, mediated at least in part by alterations in opiate and serotonergic activity, appear to play an important role in influencing the sensitivity of the neonate to pain stimuli.},

	volume = {69},
	abstract = {Premature delivery is often complicated by neonatal growth restriction ({GR)} and neurodevelopmental impairment. Because global overnutrition increases the risk of adult metabolic syndrome, we sought a targeted intervention. Premature delivery and perinatal {GR} decrease circulating levels of the neurotrophic hormone leptin. We hypothesized that leptin supplementation would normalize the outcomes of mice with incipient neonatal {GR.} Pups were fostered into litters of 6 or 12 to elicit divergent growth patterns. Pups in each litter received injections of saline or leptin from d 4 to 14. At 4 mo, mice underwent tail cuff blood pressure measurement, behavioral testing, and {MRI.} Mice fostered in litters of 12 had decreased weanling weights and leptin levels. Neonatal leptin administration normalized plasma leptin levels without influencing neonatal growth. Leptin replacement also normalized the hypertension, stress-linked immobility, conditioned fear, and amygdala enlargement seen in neonatal growth restricted male mice. In control males, neonatal leptin administration led to hypothalamic enlargement, without overt neurocardiovascular alterations. Female mice were less susceptible to the effects of neonatal {GR} or leptin supplementation. In conclusion, the effects of neonatal leptin administration are modulated by concurrent growth and gender. In growth restricted male mice, physiologic leptin replacement improves adult neurocardiovascular outcomes. Copyright © 2011 International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.},

	volume = {214},
	abstract = {Rationale: Recent evidence indicates that the hypocretin/orexin system participates in the regulation of reinforcement and addiction processes. For example, manipulations that decrease hypocretin neurotransmission result in disruptions of neurochemical and behavioral responses to cocaine. Objectives: To further assess the relationship between the hypocretin system and cocaine reinforcement, the current studies used microdialysis and in vivo voltammetry to examine the effects of hypocretin 1 on cocaine-induced enhancement of dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens core. Fixed ratio, discrete trials, and progressive ratio self-administration procedures were also used to assess whether hypocretin 1 promotes cocaine self-administration behavior. Results: Infusions of hypocretin 1 into the ventral tegmental area increased the effects of cocaine on tonic and phasic dopamine signaling and increased the motivation to self-administer cocaine on the discrete trials and progressive ratio schedules. Conclusions: Together with previous observations demonstrating that a hypocretin 1 receptor antagonist disrupts dopamine signaling and reduces self-administration of cocaine, the current observations further indicate that the hypocretin system participates in reinforcement processes likely through modulation of the mesolimbic dopamine system. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

	volume = {36},
	abstract = {Objective: Microbial manipulations in early life can affect gut development and inflammatory status of the neonate. The maternal diet during pregnancy and lactation also influences the health of the offspring, but the impact of maternal high-fat ({HF)} feeding along with modulations of the gut microbiota on body weight, fat deposition and gut function in the offspring has been poorly studied. Methods: Rat dams were given access to either an {HF} or a standard low-fat diet during the last 2 weeks of pregnancy and during lactation and effects on body weight and gastrointestinal function were investigated in the 14-day-old offspring. To elucidate whether bacterial administration to the dam could modulate any effects of the diets in the rat pups, another group of dams were given Escherichia coli in their drinking water. Results: Maternal {HF} feeding resulted in increased body and fat pad weights in the offspring, along with increased levels of the acute-phase protein, haptoglobin and decreased protein content and disaccharidase activities in the small intestine. The addition of E. coli further accentuated these responses in the young rats, which, in addition to higher body weights and increased fat deposition, also showed an increased intestinal permeability and elevated levels of haptoglobin. Conclusions: The present study demonstrates for the first time how bacterial administration to the maternal diet during the neonatal period can affect body weight and fat deposition in the offspring. The results point to a mechanistic link between the gut microbiota, increased intestinal permeability and metabolic endotoxemia, which appear to have led to increased adiposity in the young rats.

Virgin female Wistar rats were divided into four groups as follows: untrained ({NT}, n 7); trained (T, n 7); untrained with a low-protein diet ({NT+LP}, n 7); trained with a low-protein diet ({T+LP}, n 4). Trained rats were subjected to a protocol of moderate physical training on a treadmill over a period of 4 weeks (5 d/week and 60 min/d, at 65\% of {VO} 2max). After confirming the pregnancy, the intensity and duration of the exercise were reduced. Low-protein groups were provided with an 8\% casein diet, and controls were provided with a 17\% casein diet. Their respective offspring were evaluated (during the 10th-17th days of postnatal life) in terms of physical feature maturation, somatic growth and reflex ontogeny. Pups born to mothers provided with the low-protein diet during gestation and lactation showed delayed physical feature and reflex maturation and a deficit in somatic growth when compared with controls. However, most of these deficiencies were attenuated in pups of undernourished mothers undergoing training. In conclusion, physical training during gestation attenuates the effects of perinatal undernutrition on some patterns of maturation in the central nervous system during development. © 2011 The Authors.},

Here, Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone ({DEX)}, on postnatal day ({PND)} 7 (1.5 mg/kg, sc, injected in the morning and afternoon). Behavioral assessments of negative geotaxis, locomotor activity (open field, maze exploration, residential running wheel, residential figure 8 maze), open-field activity response to amphetamine, acoustic startle, prepulse inhibition ({PPT)} of acoustic startle, juvenile play behavior, anxiety (emergence tests), motor coordination (rotarod performance), spatial learning (Morris water maze and food-reinforced complex maze), and operant performance (time estimation and response inhibition) were assessed in male rats. Body weight was decreased beginning at {PND} 43 until sacrifice on {PND} 127. Whole and regional brain weights were less, especially hippocampus, cerebellum, brainstem, and cortical remnant. Indications of delayed development were apparent; specifically, {DEX-treated} rats took significantly longer to turn on {PND} 8, but not {PND} 9, in the negative geotaxis test. {DEX} treatment induced deficits in the Morris water maze that were similar to hippocampal deficits. Open-field activity changes were inconsistent; however, {DEX-treated} rats were hyperactive during the dark period in running wheel tests. There were no indications of changes in reactivity or emotionality. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

This over-inhibition, in turn, is predicted to lead to deficits in synaptic plasticity and learning and memory.

The present article reviews evidence showing that neonatal handling and/or environmental enrichment leads to enduring effects (their magnitude frequently depending upon the rat line) on those behaviors. For example, it has been found that neonatal handling reduces most of the (behavioral and physiological) signs of emotionality/anxiety in {RLA/Verh} rats, while environmental enrichment increases their novelty seeking (also the case with {RHA/Verh} rats), saccharin and ethanol intake, and sensitivity to amphetamine.

	abstract = {Catalepsy, a symptom of Parkinson's disease and related disorders can be produced in rats and other laboratory animals by the blockade of nigrostriatal dopamine using dopaminergic antagonists such as haloperidol. When haloperidol-induced cataleptic rats are placed facing downward on an inclined plane, they will brace against the resulting downward force by pushing backwards, and if they lose postural stability, or their position on the inclined plane, they will jump forward. Females, however, jump from the inclined plane at a significantly lower angle than do males. Frame-by-frame analysis of the jumping sequences revealed that females and males use a different combination of postural adjustments to maintain their position on the inclined plane prior to jumping. Furthermore, gonadal hormone manipulations at birth and in adulthood reveal that these sex differences in postural adjustments are dependent on the organizational effects of gonadal hormones in the perinatal period. These results provide evidence for sex differences in postural support mechanisms and suggest that the sex of subjects, or their hormonal state, must be considered when studying the behavioral aspects of neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease which include a postural component.

	abstract = {Obesity and stress-related psychiatric disorders are frequently comorbid. However, our understanding of the relationship between diet, everyday life stress and psychiatric disorders is limited. Although the ability of stress to increase the likelihood to develop obesity and its comorbidities in a feed-forward loop has been studied there is a dearth of studies especially at the behavioural level investigating the feedback hypothesis, that is, the consequences of high-fat diet consumption on chronic stress-induced alterations. The effects of unpredictable chronic psychosocial stress on anxiety-like behaviour in the light dark box, depressive-like behaviour in the forced swim test, hedonic behaviour in the female urine sniffing test and social avoidance in the social interaction test were investigated in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity. Changes in plasma levels of leptin, insulin and corticosterone were also assessed. A clear dissociation in behaviours was observed in mice subjected to diet-induced obesity coupled with chronic stress, with anxiety- and depressive-like behaviour observed in mice on a low- but not on a high-fat diet exposed to chronic social stress. On the other hand, social avoidance and anhedonic behaviour was present following stress independent of diet. Moreover, the effect of chronic stress in lowering leptin levels was most apparent in mice on a high-fat diet. Plasma insulin levels however where only decreased in mice on high- but not low-fat diet. In conclusion, long-term exposure to high-fat diet selectively and robustly protects against some of the behavioural sequelae of chronic unpredictable social stressors. These data show that there is a clear discrimination in the nature of stress-induced behavioural effects sensitive to protection by high-fat diet. Moreover, these results illustrate the strong influence of dietary components on stress-induced psychological factors and thereby emphasize the importance of the brain-gut-axis as a point of future therapeutic intervention.

	volume = {123},
	abstract = {The pharmacological profile of allopregnanolone, a neuroactive steroid that is a potent positive modulator of γ-aminobutyric {acidA} ({GABAA)} receptors, is similar to that of ethanol. Recent findings indicate that acute injection of ethanol increased endogenous allopregnanolone to pharmacologically relevant concentrations in male rats. However, there are no comparable data in mice, nor has the effect of ethanol drinking on endogenous allopregnanolone levels been investigated. Therefore, the present studies measured the effect of ethanol drinking and injection on allopregnanolone levels in male and female {C57BL/6} mice. One group was given 17 days of 2-h limited access to a 10\% v/v ethanol solution in a preference-drinking paradigm, while another group had access to water only. The ethanol dose consumed in 2 h exceeded 2 g/kg. Then, separate groups of mice were injected with either 2 g/kg ethanol or saline. Mice were killed 30 min after the 2-h drinking session or injection. Blood ethanol concentration was significantly higher in the ethanol-injected versus ethanol-drinking groups, even though the dose was similar. Consumption of ethanol significantly increased brain allopregnanolone levels in male but not female mice, compared with animals drinking water, but did not alter plasma corticosterone levels. In contrast, injection of ethanol did not significantly alter brain allopregnanolone levels in male or female mice and only significantly increased plasma corticosterone levels in the male mice, when compared with saline-injected animals. The sex differences in the effect of ethanol administration on endogenous allopregnanolone levels suggest that the hormonal milieu may impact ethanol's effect on {GABAergic} neurosteroids. Importantly, these data are the first to report the effect of ethanol drinking on allopregnanolone levels and indicate that ethanol consumption and ethanol injection can produce physiologically relevant allopregnanolone levels in male mice. These results have important implications for studies investigating the potential role of endogenous allopregnanolone levels in modulating susceptibility to ethanol abuse. © 2004 {IBRO.} Published by Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {In a previous study we cloned and determined the nucleotide sequence of the {prtH} gene from Porphyromonas gingivalis W83. This gene specifies a 97-{kDa} protease which is normally found in the membrane vesicles produced by P. gingivalis and which cleaves the C3 complement protein under defined conditions. We developed a novel {ermF-ermAM} antibiotic resistance gene cassette, which was used with the cloned {prtH} gene to prepare an insertionally inactivated allele of this gene. This genetic construct was introduced by electroporation into P. gingivalis W83 in order to create a protease-deficient mutant by recombinational allelic exchange. The mutant strain, designated V2296, was compared with the parent strain W83 for proteolytic activity and virulence. Extracellular protein preparations from V2296 showed decreased proteolytic activity compared with preparations from W83. Casein substrate zymography revealed that the 97-{kDa} proteolytic component as well as a 45-{kDa} protease was missing in the mutant, In in vivo experiments using a mouse model, V2296 was dramatically reduced in virulence compared with the wild-type W83 strain. A molecular survey of several clinical isolates of P. gingivalis using the {prtH} gene as a probe suggested that {prtH} gene sequences were conserved and that they may have been present in multiple copies. Two of 10 isolates did not hybridize with the {prtH} gene probe, These strains, like the V2296 mutant, also displayed decreased virulence in the mouse model. Taken together, these results suggest an important role for P. gingivalis proteases in soft tissue infections and specifically indicate that the {prtH} gene product is a virulence factor.},

Design-Prospective study. Animals-10 spayed and 5 sham-operated young adult female cats. Procedure-During an acclimatization period, initial daily food allowance was determined by estimating {MER} as 1.4 X (30 X {BW} + 70), then adjusted weekly to maintain {BW} within 200 g of baseline. Ovariohysterectomy ({OHE)} or sham laparotomy was performed at week 7, and the study was continued for 15 additional weeks (period 1). To correct for a presumptive effect of continued musculoskeletal growth that resulted in some cats becoming unacceptably thin during period 1, the study was repeated over an additional 10 weeks (period 2), using a new estimate of {MER} calculated from {BW} measured after reestablishing normal body condition. Results-Substantial restriction in food allowance was necessary to prevent {BW} gain in the {OHE} group during both periods. Caloric intake of spayed cats in dietary balance was significantly lower than that of control cats at the end of each study period. Sexually intact cats appeared to self-regulate food intake, whereas spayed cats tended to eat all food available to them. Significant differences were not detected between {OHE} and control groups in observations of physical activity before or after surgery. The equation used to predict caloric needs overestimated the apparent {MER} for spayed and sexually intact cats. Clinical Implications-Ad libitum feeding of spayed cats may be inadvisable, and careful monitoring of food allowance, relative to body condition, is suggested to prevent excessive weight gain.},

Therefore, the possibility that the weak efficacy of cocaine in this paradigm is due to its relatively short duration of action was investigated. Fluid intake was limited to a single 15 min presentation, seven days a week. Following the determination of baseline water intake, sweetened milk was given during the session followed by a series of infusions of cocaine through chronic indwelling peritoneal catheters. Four infusions, spaced 15 min apart, of 9.0 mg/kg cocaine induced an avoidance response, while one infusion of 36 mg/kg cocaine followed by three saline infusions did not. This supports the hypothesis that the low efficacy of cocaine in this paradigm is due, at least in part, to its short duration of action.},

	volume = {8},
	abstract = {Studies were carried out on the trans callosal evoked response in rats born of dams fed either a low (8\%) or normal (25\%) protein diet beginning 5 weeks prior to mating and throughout gestation and lactation. After weaning, pups were fed the same diets as their mothers. Bipolar (surface vs depth) stainless steel stimulating and recording electrodes were positioned at corresponding loci in the right and left sensorimotor cortices. Trans callosal evoked responses were measured under urethane anesthesia using twice threshold bipolar pulses of .1 msec duration at ages 13, 21, and 60-66 days. Evoked response latency was significantly greater in malnourished animals at 13 days of age, whereas at adulthood no latency differences were seen. Poststimulation excitability (15-100 msec range) was not significantly affected by the dietary treatment. These results are interpreted as corroborating previous reports on rats undernourished during development using sensory evoked potentials. By avoiding the use of extrinsic sensory stimulation, the present study demonstrates a dietary effect upon ontogeny of cortical evoked potentials independent of any possible effect on sensory receptor mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Global-heterozygous and brain-specific homozygous knockouts ({KOs)} of brain-derived neurotrophic factor ({BDNF)} cause late- and early-onset obesity, respectively, both involving hyperphagia. Little is known about the mechanism underlying this hyperphagia or whether {BDNF} loss from peripheral tissues could contribute to overeating. Since global-homozygous {BDNF-KO} is perinatal lethal, a {BDNF-KO} that spared sufficient brainstem {BDNF} to support normal health was utilized to begin to address these issues. Meal pattern and microstructure analyses suggested overeating of {BDNF-KO} mice was mediated by deficits in both satiation and satiety that resulted in increased meal size and frequency and implicated a reduction of vagal signaling from the gut to the brain. Meal-induced c-Fos activation in the nucleus of the solitary tract, a more direct measure of vagal afferent signaling, however, was not decreased in {BDNF-KO} mice, and thus was not consistent with a vagal afferent role. Interestingly though, meal-induced c-Fos activation was increased in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve ({DMV)} of {BDNF-KO} mice. This could imply that augmentation of vago-vagal digestive reflexes occurred (e.g., accommodation), which would support increased meal size and possibly increased meal number by reducing the increase in intragastric pressure produced by a given amount of ingesta. Additionally, vagal sensory neuron number in {BDNF-KO} mice was altered in a manner consistent with the increased meal-induced activation of the {DMV.} These results suggest reduced {BDNF} causes satiety and satiation deficits that support hyperphagia, possibly involving augmentation of vago-vagal reflexes mediated by central pathways or vagal afferents regulated by {BDNF} levels.

	abstract = {Maternal undernutrition during critical periods of organ development is known to impair fetal growth and predispose to the development of adulthood diseases, such as hypertension, coronary heart disease and type {II} diabetes that are linked to low birth weight and are characterized by endothelial dysfunction. Increased oxidative stress, in rats submitted to intrauterine undernutrition, provides a potential explanation for the endothelial dysfunction development. The aim of this study was to determine the oxidative stress and its consequence on mesenteric arteriolar responses to vasoactive agents in offspring from diet-restricted dams. For this, female pregnant Wistar rats were fed either normal or 50\% of normal intake diets, during the whole gestational period. In male offspring, arterial blood pressure was determined by the tail cuff method in anesthetized rats, mesenteric arteriolar reactivity and superoxide anion generation were studied using intravital microscopy and superoxide dismutase activity was determined in mesentery by spectrophotometric assay. Intrauterine undernutrition induced hypertension, decreased vasodilation to acetylcholine and bradykinin but did not alter the responses to sodium nitroprusside. Topical application of superoxide dismutase and superoxide dismutase mimetic manganese ({III)} tetrakis (1-methyl-4-pyridyl) porphyrin significantly improved the altered arteriolar responses to acetylcholine and bradykinin. A decreased superoxide dismutase activity and an increased superoxide anion concentration were observed in the offspring of diet-restricted dams. This study shows for the first time that intrauterine undernutrition enhances oxidative stress in vivo and relates this to the impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation.},

The inhalation regimen corresponded to an approximate dose of 0.1 mg Hg degrees/kg/day. Clinical observations and developmental markers up to weaning showed no differences between any of the groups. Testing of behavioural function was performed between 4 and 5 months of age and included spontaneous motor activity, spatial learning in a circular bath, and instrumental maze learning for food reward. Offspring of dams exposed to Hg degrees showed hyperactivity in the motor activity test chambers over all three parameters: locomotion, rearing and total activity; this effect was potentiated in the animals of the {MeHg} + Hg degrees group. In the swim maze test, the {MeHg} + Hg degrees and Hg degrees groups evidenced longer latencies to reach a submerged platform, which they had learned to mount the day before, compared to either the control or {MeHg} groups. In the modified, enclosed radial arm maze, both the {MeHg} + Hg degrees and Hg degrees groups showed more ambulations and rearings in the activity test prior to the learning test. During the learning trial, the same groups (i.e., {MeHg} + Hg degrees and Hg degrees) showed longer latencies and made more errors in acquiring all eight pellets. Generally, the results indicate that prenatal exposure to Hg degrees causes alterations to both spontaneous and learned behaviours, suggesting some deficit in adaptive functions. Coexposure to {MeHg}, which by itself did not alter these functions at the dose given in this study, served to significantly aggravate the changes.},

The present study was undertaken to assess the effects of pre- and postnatal thiouracil administration on postnatal growth and pituitary grown hormone ({GH)} content in 25 day old rats. Pups were born to Sprague-Dawley rats fed lab chow mash containing 0.25\% thiouracil according to the following schedules: a) during gestation only; b) during lactation only (25 days postpartum); and c) through gestation and lactation. Mothers of euthyroid controls were fed diet without thiouracil for the length of the experiment. Pups were weighed daily through day 21 and decapitated on day 25. Pituitary {GH} content was measured by densiometric comparison of disc gel colum electrophoresed pituitary homogenates with similarly treated rat {GH} standard. Incorporation of thiouracil into the diet of pregnant and/or lactating rats significantly depressed the body weight and pituitary {GH} levels in their 25 day old pups. Furthermore, analysis of the daily mean body weight of each litter revealed four significantly differnt patterns of growth. While previous investigators have reported that prenatal thyroid restriction does not significantly alter the developmental processes of young rodents, the present study indicates that prenatal thyroid status is an important influence on normal postnatal growth.},

We investigated the role of progestins in a murine model of Alzheimer's Disease ({AD)} in which transgenic mice co-overexpress a mutant form of amyloid precursor protein ({APPswe)} and a deletion in presenilin 1 Δ exon 9 ({APPswe+PSEN1Δe9).} We hypothesized that: (1) mice with the {APPswe+PSEN1Δe9} mutation would have performance deficits compared to wildtype mice and (2) long-term administration of P4 would enhance cognitive performance and increase brain progestin levels over placebo. Mice were ovariectomized at 6 months of age and administered placebo or P4 via subcutaneously implanted pellets. Mice were tested between 9 and 12 months of age for cognitive performance in the object placement, water maze, object recognition, and T-maze tasks and for motor behavior in an activity monitor and then tissues were collected for steroid measurement. P4 administration increased progestin levels in cortex, diencephalon, midbrain, and cerebellum of wildtype and mutant mice, but increases in 3α,5α-{THP} levels in the hippocampus of {APPswe+PSEN1Δe9} mutant mice were attenuated compared to that observed in wildtype mice. {APPswe+PSEN1Δe9} mice showed poorer performance in hippocampus measures (object placement and water maze tasks). In the object recognition and T-maze task, which are mediated by the cortex and hippocampus, P4 administration improved performance in both wildtype and {APPswe+PSEN1Δe9} mutant mice compared to placebo administration. Thus, {APPswe+PSEN1Δ9} mice have deficits in hippocampal performance and capacity to form 3α,5α-{THP} in the hippocampus and both wildtype and {APPswe+PSEN1Δ9} mice show beneficial effects of P4 in cortical function and similar capacity to form 3α,5α-{THP} in the cortex. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

	volume = {23},
	abstract = {Steroid hormones, such as progesterone., are typically considered to be primarily secreted by the gonads (albeit adrenals can also be a source) and to exert their actions through cognate intracellular progestin receptors ({PRs).} Through its actions in the midbrain ventral tegmental Area ({VTA)}, progesterone mediates appetitive (exploratory, anxiety, social approach) and consummatory (social, sexual) aspects of rodents' mating behaviour. However, progesterone and its natural metabolites ('progestogens') are produced in the midbrain {VTA} independent of peripheral sources and midbrain {VTA} of adult rodents is devoid of intracellular {PRs.} One approach that we have used to understand the effects of progesterone and mechanisms in the {VTA} for mating is to manipulate the actions of progesterone in the {VTA} and to examine effects on lordosis (the posture female rodents assume for mating to occur). This review focuses on the effects and mechanisms of progestogens to influence reproduction and related processes. The actions of progesterone and its 5 alpha-reduced metabolite and neurosteroid, 5 alpha-pregnan-3 alpha-ol-20-one (3 alpha,5 alpha-{THP;} allopregnanolone) in the midbrain {VTA} to facilitate mating are described. The findings that 3 alpha,5 alpha-{THP} biosynthesis in the midbrain occurs with mating are discussed. Evidence for the actions of 3 alpha,5 alpha-{THP} in the midbrain {VTA} via nontraditional steroid targets is summarised. The broader relevance of these actions of 3 alpha,5 alpha-{THP} for aspects of reproduction, beyond lordosis, is summarised. Finally, the potential role of the pregnane xenobiotic receptor in mediating 3 alpha,5 alpha-{THP} biosynthesis in the midbrain is introduced.},

	volume = {78},
	abstract = {In a balance study with 30 growing Sprague-Dawley rats the isotope-dilution technique for determination of endogenous faecal excretion and true absorption was established for the trace element selenium. The animals were injected intramuscularly with Se-75 and killed in groups of 6 animals at day 2, 4, 6, 9, and 14 after the injection. During the experiment one semisynthetic diet containing 150 ng Se/g (selenite) was fed restrictively to all animals. Within 2 days the administered tracer was almost completely released from the injection area. After an initial peak in Se-75 excretion at day 1 (urine) and day 2 (faeces) the Se-75 elimination was steadily decreasing. Three days after the Se-75 injection the distribution of daily Se-75 excretion between urine and faeces remained constant (83\% vs. 17\%). The specific Se-75 activities of tissues decreased with increasing time elapsed after the Se-75 injection. The decrease was proportional to that of faeces only in the case of blood plasma. Thus, all other tissues and also the urine had to be excluded from use as a reference source for the isotope-dilution method. The estimates of endogenous faecal Se based on blood plasma as a reference source were constant from dap 4 to the end of the experiment (endogenous Se: 89\% of total faecal Se; true Se absorption: 99\% of Se intake). In conclusion, the endogenous faecal Se can be estimated by the isotope-dilution method on the basis of blood plasma as the reference source. The lag rime between 1 parenteral Se-75 injection and the onset of Se-75 monitoring for isotope-dilution calculations is about 3 days.},

In contrast, postnatal handling has been shown to attenuate both emotional and {HPA} reactivity under certain conditions. The present study tested the hypothesis that handling could attenuate adverse effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on consummatory behavior and {HPA} activity in a conditioned taste aversion task. We found that both prenatal ethanol exposure and handling independently increased saccharin consumption over 5 days of pretoxicosis exposure, suggesting that neophobia decreased at a faster rate in these animals. When conditioned aversion was assessed in handled animals under nondeprived conditions, E animals showed increased consumption compared to controls. Furthermore, across prenatal groups, lower corticosterone ({CORT)} levels were found in handled compared to nonhandled animals during reexposure under food-deprived conditions, emphasizing the importance of assessing both behavior and {HPA} function when examining an animal's response to a task and indicating that handling may not be effective at attenuating some deficits in E animals.

	volume = {14},
	abstract = {Understanding the genetics of behavioral variation remains a fascinating but difficult problem with considerable theoretical and practical implications. We used the genome-tagged mice ({GTM)} and an extensive test battery of well-validated behavioral assays to scan the genome for behavioral quantitative trait loci ({QTLs).} The {GTM} are a panel of 'speed congenic' mice consisting of over 60 strains spanning the entire autosomal genome. Each strain harbors a small (similar to 23 {cM)} {DBA/2J} donor segment on a uniform {C57BL/6J} background. The panel allows for mapping to regions as small as 5 {cM} and provides a powerful new tool for increasing mapping power and replicability in the analysis of {QTLs.} A total of 97 loci were mapped for a variety of complex behavioral traits including hyperactivity, anxiety, prepulse inhibition, avoidance and conditional fear. A larger number of loci were recovered than generally attained from standard mapping crosses. In addition, a surprisingly high proportion of loci, 63\%, showed phenotypes unlike either of the parental strains. These data suggest that epistasis decreases sensitivity of locus detection in traditional crosses and demonstrate the utility of the {GTM} for mapping complex behavioral traits with high sensitivity and precision.

This review concentrates on the role and mechanisms of events during the antenatal and immediate postnatal period resulting in later life diseases, concentrating on abnormal growth patterns of the fetus. Fetal overgrowth is related to exposure to a diabetic intra uterine environment, increasing the vulnerability to transgenerational obesity and hence an increased sensitivity to more diabetic mothers. This effect has been supported by animal data. Fetal growth restriction is complex due to malnutrition in utero, catch up growth due to a high caloric intake and low physical activity in later life. Metabolic changes and a transgenerational effect of intra uterine malnutrition has been supported by animal data. In recent years the discovery of alterations of the genome due to different influences during embryonic life, called epigenetics, has led to the phenomenon of fetal programming resulting in changing transgenerational metabolic effects.},

Litters with subsequent high pup mortality were distinguished by abnormal mothering patterns during the first 12 hours of life and reduced pup weight at the end of this period. High pup mortality was associated with increased active nursing, and reductions in passive nursing, pup licking, amount of contact with the pups and time spent in the nest by the lactating female. Thus, the stimulus to active nursing is most intense under conditions where the pups are least likely to survive, whereas the amount of stimulation provided to such pups is reduced. Maximal associations between early mother-pup interactions and subsequent pup weight and survival were present 7-9 hours after birth.},

During these two periods, groups were given sequences of either adequate-adequate, adequate-low, low-adequate or low-low protein diets. Behavioral observations were made both in the breeding cage of each rat and in an open area (field) on days 15 and 20 of pregnancy. Pregnancy by itself caused a number of behavioral changes including reduced general activity, increased grooming and increased time sleeping. The protein level of the diet at the time of testing was found to affect behavior but not the protein level of the diet fed previously. In the breeding cage, low dietary protein reduced ventromedial grooming in pregnant rats, a behavior related to mammary development in preparation for lactating. In the open field, rearing on the hind legs was decreased among pregnant animals on the low-protein diet, a finding which may be associated with loss of muscle substance. Both of these behavioral changes have implications for the ability of the female to subsequently raise her offspring as well as to interact with her environment during pregnancy.},

The animals received intravenously for 4 days a mixture of Intralipid 10\% and Vamine-Glucose. At the end of {TPN}, oral feeding was reinstituted and the rats were fed with an isocaloric standard diet (60\% carbohydrate, 17\% protein, 3\% lipid). Sucrase, isomaltase, lactase, aminopeptidase N activities were measured at the end of {TPN} and at 1, 3, and 5 days after {TPN.} Sham-operated rats nourished orally with the standard diet were used as controls. In both intestinal segments, lactase activity showed no significant changes at the end of {TPN} or during oral realimentation. Isomaltase, and especially sucrase activities, exhibited an important drop at the end of {TPN.} After {TPN}, a complete restoration of isomaltase and sucrase activities was obtained in the jejunum only. During oral refeeding a 40\% deficit in sucrase activity persisted in the ileum throughout the experimental period, whereas normal isomaltase activity was restored in this segment. Aminopeptidase N activity was lowered by {TPN} and recovered normal values within a few hours after oral realimentation. Thus, reinstitution of oral feeding after {TPN} should take into acount that the intestine is capable of digesting normal amounts of dietary protein but has a reduced tolerance for carbohydrates.},

	volume = {157},
	abstract = {Corticotropin-releasing factor ({CRF)} binding protein ({CRF-BP)} is a secreted protein that acts to bind and limit the activity of the neuropeptides, {CRF} and urocortin (Ucn) 1. We previously selected for high maternal defense (protection of offspring) in mice and found {CRF-BP} to be elevated in the {CNS} of selected mice. We also previously determined that both {CRF} and Ucn 1 are potent inhibitors of offspring protection when administered centrally. Thus, elevated {CRF-BP} could promote defense by limiting endogenous actions of {CRF} or Ucn 1. To test this hypothesis, we crossed the deletion for {CRF-BP} into the mice selected for high maternal defense and evaluated offspring protection and other maternal behaviors. {CRF-BP} knockout ({KO)} mice exhibited significant deficits in maternal aggression relative to wild-type ({WT)} mice in three different measures. Other maternal features were almost identical between groups, including dam and pup weight, litter size, nursing time, and pup retrieval. Both groups performed similarly in a forced swim stress test and aggression in both groups was reduced following the swim test. Virgin {KO} female mice exhibited higher levels of anxiety-like behavior in terms of decreased time in the light portion of the light/dark box test. For males, no differences in light/dark box or swim test were found. However, increased anxiety-like behavior in male {KO} mice was identified in terms of contact and approach to a novel object both with and without previous exposure to the swim test. No differences in isolation induced resident intruder male aggression were found between groups. Together, these results indicate that loss of {CRF-BP} selectively impairs maternal, but not intermale aggression and that loss of the gene induces anxiety-like behavior in males and females, but there are sex differences in terms of how that anxiety is revealed. © 2008 {IBRO.}},

	abstract = {Lactation is the most energy-demanding phase of mammalian reproduction, and lactation performance may be affected by events during pregnancy. For example, food intake may be limited in late pregnancy by competition for space in the abdomen between the alimentary tract and fetuses. Hence, females may need to compensate their energy budgets during pregnancy by reducing activity and lowering body temperature. We explored the relationships between energy intake, body mass, body temperature and physical activity throughout pregnancy in the {MF1} mouse. Food intake and body mass of 26 females were recorded daily throughout pregnancy. Body temperature and physical activity were monitored every minute for 23 h a day by implanted transmitters. Body temperature and physical activity declined as pregnancy advanced, while energy intake and body mass increased. Compared with a pre-mating baseline period, mice increased energy intake by 56\% in late pregnancy. Although body temperature declined as pregnancy progressed, this served mostly to reverse an increase between baseline and early pregnancy. Reduced physical activity may compensate the energy budget of pregnant mice but body temperature changes do not. Over the last 3days of pregnancy, food intake declined. Individual variation in energy intake in the last phase of pregnancy was positively related to litter size at birth.

	volume = {216},
	abstract = {Lactating animals consume greater amounts of food than non-reproductive animals, but energy intake appears to be limited in late lactation. The heat dissipation limit theory suggests that the food intake of lactating mice is limited by the capacity of the mother to dissipate heat. Lactating mice should therefore have high body temperatures (Tb), and changes in energy intake during lactation should be reflected by variation in Tb. To investigate these predictions, 26 mice (Mus musculus) were monitored daily throughout lactation for food intake, body mass, litter size and litter mass. After weaning, 21?days postpartum, maternal food intake and body mass were monitored for another 10?days. Maternal activity and Tb were recorded every minute for 23?h a day using implanted transmitters (vital view). Energy intake increased to a plateau in late lactation (days 13-17). Daily gain in pup mass declined during this same period, suggesting a limit on maternal energy intake. Litter size and litter mass were positively related to maternal energy intake and body mass. Activity levels were constantly low, and mice with the largest increase in energy intake at peak lactation had the lowest activity. Tb rose sharply after parturition and the circadian rhythm became compressed within a small range. Tb during the light period increased considerably ({1.1C} higher than in baseline), and lactating mice faced chronic hyperthermia, despite their activity levels in lactation being approximately halved. Average Tb increased in relation to energy intake as lactation progressed, but there was no relationship between litter size or litter mass and the mean Tb at peak lactation. These data are consistent with the heat dissipation limit theory, which suggests performance in late lactation is constrained by the ability to dissipate body heat. © 2013 Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.},

Study design: Pregnant rats were fed either with 20\% protein (control) or 6\% protein (low-protein diet) from day 1 or day 12 of gestation. Fetoplacental weights and mortality rates of pups were assessed. Systolic blood pressure, mean arterial blood pressure, and circulatory hormone levels in offspring were determined. In addition, male and female hypertensive offspring were treated with flutamide, and their blood pressure was monitored. Results: After delivery, pup weights were reduced, and pup mortality rates increased in the low-protein diet-day1 group. Systolic blood pressure and mean arterial blood pressure were elevated in low-protein diet-day 1 males and females and low-protein diet-day 2 males. Significant (P {\textless}. 05) reduction in blood pressure was achieved with flutamide in low-protein diet-day 1 females. Serum estradiol levels were decreased (P {\textless}. 05) in low-protein diet-day 1 females; flutamide attenuated this effect. Conclusion: The day of in utero insult by low-protein diet is critical in the induction of adult hypertension; the severity is gender dependent.

	volume = {136},
	abstract = {Pregnancy in rodents is associated with important maternal metabolic changes. Early pregnancy is considered to be an anabolic phase of nutrient storing, while in late pregnancy, a catabolic phase develops to help meet the metabolic demands of the rapidly growing conceptus. Similarly, major changes also occur in the {IGFs}, {IGF-binding} proteins ({IGFBPs)} and {GH} axis. In the rat, maternal serum {IGF-I} levels increase from early to mid-pregnancy, after which {IGF-I} levels decline. Conversely, as {IGF-I} levels decline, pituitary-derived rat {GH} increases twofold. This coincides with a decrease in {IGFBP-3} and the appearance of an {IGFBP} protease. However, the physiological role of these changes is unclear. The aim of our study was to examine the roles of {GH}, {IGFs} and {IGFBPs} during pregnancy in a unique isolated {GH-deficient} rat model, spontaneous dwarf rats. Pregnancy in {GH-deficient} dams resulted in a significantly reduced litter number, and maternal weight gain (day 21-day 1) was reduced by 28\% when compared with dams with normal {GH} levels ({GH-normal} dams). In the sera of {GH-normal} dams, {IGF-I} levels increased 2.6-fold by day 4 of pregnancy and then progressively declined to below non-pregnant levels. Serum {IGF-II} levels were low and remained unchanged. Western-ligand blot analysis showed that {IGFBP-3} was present in non-pregnancy and early pregnancy sera, but declined dramatically after day 12. This decline in {IGFBP-3} coincided with the detection of an {IGFBP} protease. In contrast, in non-pregnancy sera from {GH-deficient} rats, serum {IGF-I} concentrations were 10\% of the levels seen in {GH-normal} females, and neither {IGF-I} nor {IGF-II} concentrations changed with pregnancy. Furthermore, in {GH-deficient} dams, serum {IGFBP-3} (as assessed by Western-ligand blot analysis) was low in non-pregnancy and early pregnancy sera, and became undetectable by day 12 of pregnancy. The low concentrations of {IGFBP-3} in early pregnancy serum from {GH-deficient} rats coincided with {IGFBP-proteolytic} activity, and the decline in serum {IGFBP-3} after day 16 was the result of increased protease activity. In conclusion, isolated {GH} deficiency results in: (1) reduced maternal weight gain and correspondingly smaller litter sizes; (2) low and unchanged maternal serum {IGF-I} levels; (3) low, but declining, serum {IGFBP-3} levels; and (4) activity of {IGFBP} protease(s) detectable in early and late pregnancy, which may modulate the bioavailability and bioactivity of {IGFs} by regulating {IGFBP-3.}},

	title = {Rapid distribution of intraventricularly administered sucrose into cerebrospinal fluid cisterns via subarachnoid velae in rat},
	volume = {75},
	abstract = {The intracranial distribution of [{14C]sucrose}, an extracellular marker infused for 30 s into one lateral ventricle, was determined by autoradiography of frozen-dried brain sections. Within 3.5 min [{14C]sucrose} appeared in: (i) the third ventricle, including optic, infundibular and mammillary recesses; (ii) the aqueduct of Sylvius; (iii) the velum interpositum, a part of the subarachnoid space that runs along the roof of the third ventricle and contains many blood vessels; (iv) the mesencephalic and fourth ventricles; and (v) the superior medullary velum, a highly vascular extension of the subarachnoid space that terminates at the walls of the mesencephalic and fourth ventricles. Within 5 min, radioactivity was present in the interpeduncular, ambient and quadrigeminal cisterns, which encircle the midbrain. By 10 min, approximately 11\% of the radioactivity had passed into the subarachnoid space via a undescribed flow pathway that included the velum interpositum and superior medullary velum. At many places along the ventricular system, [{14C]sucrose} appeared to move from cerebrospinal fluid into the adjacent tissue by simple diffusion, as reported previously (Blasberg {R.G.} et al. (1974) J. Pharmac. Exp. Ther. 195, 73-83; Levin {V.A.} et al. (1970) Am. J. Physiol. 219, 1528-1533; Patlak C. and Fenstermacher {J.D.} (1975) Am. J. Physiol. 229, 877-884; Rosenberg {G.A.} and Kyner {W.T.} (1980) Brain Res. 193, 56-66; Rosenberg {G.A.} et al. (1986) Am. J. Physiol. 251, F485-F489). Little sucrose was, however, taken up by: (i) circumventricular organs such as the subfornical organ; (ii) medullary and cerebellar tissue next to the lateral recesses; and (iii) the superior and inferior colliculi and cerebral peduncles. For the latter two groups of structures, entry from cerebrospinal fluid was apparently blocked by a thick, multilayered glia limitans. Although [{14C]sucrose} was virtually absent from the rest of the subarachnoid system after 1 h, it remained in the perivascular spaces and/or walls of pial arteries and arterioles for more than 3 h. Certain transport proteins, protease inhibitors, growth factors and other neurobiologically active materials are present in cerebrospinal fluid, and their distribution to the brain and its blood vessels may be important. The present work shows, in the rat, that the flow of cerebrospinal fluid and the disposition of its constituents is fairly complex and differs among regions. Flow was rapid throughout the ventricular system and into various subarachnoid velae and cisterns, but was surprisingly slow and slight over the cerebral and cerebellar cortices. The cerebrospinal fluid-to-tissue flux of material was relatively free at many interfaces, but was greatly restricted at others, the latter indicating that the old conecpt of a 'cerebrospinal fluid-brain barrier' may hold at such places. Finally, radiolabeled sucrose was retained longer within the walls and perivascular spaces of pial arteries and arterioles than in other subarachnoid tissues; one function of the cerebrospinal fluid system or 'third circulation' may thus be delivering factors and agents to these pial blood vessels.},

Because of the clinical similarities between fetal alcohol syndrome and prenatal zinc deficiency, we studied in vivo the effect of short-term and long-term ethanol ingestion during pregnancy on placental transport of zinc in pair-fed rats. Our results indicate that both short- and long-term ethanol depressed zinc-65 uptake in the placenta and fetus by 40\% and 30\%, respectively, compared to pair-fed controls (p {\textless} 0.05). Total zinc concentration in fetuses of the long-term ethanol group was significantly decreased compared to pair-fed controls (p {\textless} 0.05). Although the mechanism of action of ethanol in producing the fetal alcohol syndrome maybe multiple, our findings suggest that a decrease in the availability of zinc to the fetus may represent one of the contributory factors in the growth retardation of fetal alcohol syndrome.},

The objective of the present studies was to investigate whether exposure of rats to ethanol in utero, would induce a deficit in spatial memory in adult life. Pregnant rats were fed with an ethanol diet from day 1 of pregnancy till parturition. Control rats were either pair-fed with an isocaloric sucrose diet or were fed with lab-chow ad libitum. On the first day of birth, offspring exposed to ethanol in utero were placed with a control mother fed with lab-chow, while offspring of the lab-chow fed dams were placed with ethanol-treated dams. At 40, 60 and 90 days postnatally, behavioral testing was performed using the Morris swim maze, a test of spatial memory. Results indicated that the offspring exposed to ethanol in utero presented deficits in spatial memory processes. Ethanol did not completely block the learning of the swim maze task but the alcohol-exposed offspring exhibited longer latencies to perform the task, swam longer distances prior to locating and climbing onto the platform, and when the platform was removed, searched for it in all 4 quadrants of the pool. Restricted caloric intake during gestation and maternal behavior in early postnatal life also induced deficits in the performance on the swim maze task. However, these deficits were mild and short-lasting being absent at 60 and 90 days of age. In contrast, the deficits induced by ethanol were more severe and longer-lasting, being present in adult life.},

No deficits in open-field activity were observed following localized anisomycin treatment, and all animals appeared to be healthy. Results of the present study are consistent with the hypothesis that P acts to promote estrous behavior via a receptor-mediated genomic protein synthetic mechanism, and provide additional evidence that the {VMH} is the primary site of P action.},

In the present study we explored whether dietary choline supplementation may also confer protection from psychological challenges, like stress, and act as a natural buffer against stress-linked psychological disorders, like depression. We previously found that choline supplementation increased adult hippocampal neurogenesis, a function compromised by stress, lowered in depression, and boosted by antidepressants; and increased levels of growth factors linked to depression, like brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Together, these were compelling reasons to study the role of choline in depressed mood. To do this, we treated rats with a choline supplemented diet (5 mg/kg choline chloride in {AIN76A)} prenatally on embryonic days 10-22, on postnatal days ({PD)} 25-50, or as adults from {PD75} onward. Outside of these treatment periods rats were fed a standard diet (1.1 mg/kg choline chloride in {AIN76A);} control rats consumed only this diet throughout the study. Starting on {PD100} rats' anxiety-like responses to an open field, learning in a water maze, and reactivity to forced swimming were assessed. Rats given choline supplementation during pre- or post-natal development, but not adulttreated rats, were less anxious in the open field and less immobile in the forced swim test than control rats. These effects were not mediated by a learning deficit as all groups performed comparably and well in the water maze. Thus, we offer compelling support for the hypothesis that supplemental dietary choline, at least when given during development, may inoculate an individual against stress and major psychological disorders, like depression.

The purposes of this study were to confirm that finding in a calcium-deficient, lactating rat model and to quantify the degree to which the area of root surface resorption is affected by these conditions. Thirty-five adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into two groups: (1) nonlactating animals on a control diet and (2) lactating animals on a calcium-deficient diet. A 60-gm orthodontic force designed to tip maxillary molars mesially was applied for varying times. At sacrifice, tooth movement was quantified by measuring the space created between maxillary molars; percent bone ash was measured for each humerus, and root surface resorption was estimated by means of a morphometric technique to measure the area of cratering on the mesial roots of first molars. Both groups showed a typical two-phased tooth movement cycle lasting for 10 days, although the magnitude of movement was significantly greater (p {\textless} 0.001) in the test animals. The "humerus" test from animals exhibited a significantly decreased (p {\textless} 0.001) fat-free dry weight, ash, and percent ash weight. The test group also displayed a significantly reduced percent area of root surface resorption (p {\textless} 0.05) by 7 and 10 days following appliance activation. These findings confirm earlier observations that lactation, coupled with calcium deficiency, will produce decreased bone density which is consistent with increased parathyroid hormone secretion. Moreover, the decreased area of root-surface resorption and enhanced tooth movement in the test animals suggest that increased bone resorption and decreased bone density facilitate remodeling of alveolar bone in preference to root. © 1984.},

Control mice were fed a 100 ppm diet either ad lib or in amounts equal to the diet intake of deprived mice (pair fed controls). Male and female offspring were tested at 70 days of age in a one-trial passive avoidance task with a 30 min train-test interval. Both marginally and severely zinc deprived offspring (but not pair fed controls) had shorter avoidance latencies than offspring of ad lib fed zinc replete controls. Zinc deprived offspring did not differ from control mice when either baseline or "stressed" (exposure to novel environment) plasma corticosterone levels were quantitated. Further, zinc staining patterns of the hippocampus (Timm-sulfide stain) were not altered in the nutritionally deprived offspring. Thus marginal dietary zinc deficiency during development can lead to impaired passive avoidance performance in adult mice. This behavioral effect is not associated with altered pituitary-adrenocortical activity or with a permanent reduction in hippocampal zinc staining. This result has significant implications for the influence of zinc deprivation in utero and in the neonatal animal on adult behavior characteristics. © 1983.},

	abstract = {Our objective was to investigate whether zinc interacts with taurine to influence the development of retinal structure and function, Virgin female Sprague-Dawley rats were bred overnight and assigned to one of four treatments in a 2 x 2 factorial design with two levels of zinc (50 mu g/g through gestation and 50 mu g/g after parturition; 15 mu g/g through gestation and 7.5 mu g/g after parturition) and two levels of taurine (2 or 0 mu mol/g). The control diet contained 50 mu g/g zinc and 2 mu mol/g taurine. Guanidinoethyl sulfonate (10 {g/L)}, a taurine transport inhibitor, was added to the drinking water of the rats receiving 0 mu mol/g taurine. Al postnatal d 23, male pups (n = 10) were weaned onto their respective diets, Pup eyes were examined by biomicroscope and indirect ophthalmoscope al 4 and 7 wk; retinal folds and choroidal atrophy were detected in the pups deficient in zinc and taurine, Analysis of plasma zinc and tibial zinc concentrations revealed a significant interaction in these tissues (P {\textless} 0.05). Dark-adapted oscillatory potentials ({OP)} were recorded at 7.5-8.5 wk. Two-way {ANOVA} showed a significant interaction between zinc and taurine for {OP2} and {OP3} amplitudes; marginal zinc deficiency decreased the amplitude of the {OP} only when rats were also deficient in taurine. A significant depressing effect of marginal zinc deficiency was noted for {OP1} amplitude. Taurine deficiency significantly depressed the amplitude of {OP1} and {OP4.} Histological examination of the retinas from rats deficient in both zinc and taurine revealed photoreceptor degeneration and confirmed retinal dysplasia. These data provide evidence for an interaction between zinc and taurine in retinal morphology and function.},

	volume = {96},
	abstract = {The behavioral outcomes of a calorie restricted diet are often neglected in favour of a more physiological examination of the consequences of calorie restriction ({CR).} This is especially the case with social behavior. A few findings within the maternal {CR} literature suggest that adult male social behavior is altered by this regimen. Despite the paucity of findings within the maternal {CR} literature, a systematic investigation of the behavioral phenotype of males administered an adult-onset {CR} is completely lacking and was the focus of the current study. Adult male hooded Wistar rats were administered a three week {CR}, with one group receiving a 25\% {CR} and another group receiving a 50\% {CR} before male-to-male social behavior was examined and compared with ad libitium fed males. Various behavioral elements were modulated by {CR}, both the {CR25\%} and 50\% group initiated contact sooner and engaged in greater social activity compared to the ad libitum fed controls. The {CR25\%} group also demonstrated less non-social (self-grooming) behavior and a greater frequency of walkovers compared to all groups, indicating a propensity towards dominance. The {CR50\%} group demonstrated greater environmental assessment/exploration, as measured by the frequency of rearing. As with the maternal {CR} literature, an adult-onset chronic {CR} induces a more socially active behavioral phenotype and reduces interest in non-social behavior in the moderately {CR} group. Taken together, the social behavioral phenotype can be modulated by a {CR} initiated and maintained during adulthood. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The effects of lead exposure during early development on locomotor activity and behavior remain unclear. The present study was undertaken in an attempt to replicate and expand the previously reported findings of lead induced hyperactivity and increased aggressiveness in mice (Charles River, {CD} 1). Three exposure regimens to lead acetate were employed: (1) 5 mg/ml in the drinking water from parturition until 60 days of age, (2) 5 mg/ml in drinking water of dams throughout gestation and continued until 18 days postpartum, and (3) a single injection on day 1 postpartum (1.0 mg/pup s.c.). In experiments where lead administration produced undernutrition, appropriate pair fed controls were tested. Lead treated females from the first regimen showed a 4 day delay in sexual maturation and hypoactivity in a residential maze at 30 and 50 days of age. Aggressive behavior was measured by introducing an adult intruder into the home cage of an individual experimental male. Control males on the average wounded the intruder 85 times during a 14 hr test period, while intruders to lead treated and pair fed male cages had means of only 32 and 35 wounds, respectively. Lead treated male and female mice under the second lead regimen showed a 20 to 25\% reduction in residential maze activity when tested at 130 days of age. Following testing, males were killed and the number of wounds received from fighting with cage mates was determined. Sixty two percent of the males from control cages were scarred while only 25\% of the lead treated males were wounded. Finally, 30 day old females from the third lead regimen were hypoactive when tested in a 3 x 3 ft open field. These findings of lead induced hypoactivity and reduced aggressiveness in mice are in disagreement with previously published reports.},

Long-Evans rats were randomly assigned to one or two dietary groups on day 1 of gestation. The dams were fed a basal diet supplemented with either restricted or control levels of zinc. Feces and urine were collected for 24 h on day 20 of pregnancy, and their nitrogen and zinc contents were determined. Urinary and fecal nitrogen excretions were similar for zinc-restricted and control dams, whereas fecal zinc excretions were depressed by feeding the zinc-restricted diet. Mean zinc and nitrogen retentions were negative for the zinc-restricted and positive for the control groups. Multiple stepwise regression analysis showed that nitrogen retention on day 20 depended on both dietary nitrogen and zinc uptakes. Zinc-restricted offspring weighed 12\% less and the maternal plasma zinc concentrations were reduced by 66\% when compared with the control group values on day 22. Marginal dietary zinc and the associated anorexia limited fetal growth without causing excessive nitrogen excretion or severe weight loss.},

In this study, we used the {HSP} and 'postpartum' withdrawal to investigate the impact on sucrose consumption, a model of anhedonia. Rats were assigned to "postpartum", "postpartum" + {EB} (estradiol benzoate), "postpartum" + {IMI} (imipramine; a tricyclic antidepressant), "postpartum" + {DPN} (diarylpropionitrile; an {ERβ} agonist), or ovariectomized ({OVX)} controls and {OVX} + {IMI} treatments. All "postpartum" groups received daily hormone injections (estradiol and progesterone) over 23 days to simulate pregnancy, while {IMI} groups also received daily injections of imipramine. After Day 23, "postpartum" rats were withdrawn from the hormone regimen (mimicking the postpartum decrease in gonadal hormones), and then received daily injections of compounds indicated ({DPN}, {EB}, {IMI).} Rats were tested for consumption of, and preference for, sucrose weekly at baseline, during 'pregnancy' and on {'Postpartum'} Days 2-3. During the 'postpartum' period rats in the "postpartum" group had lower sucrose consumption and preference compared to during late-'pregnancy', but no decrease in 'postpartum' consumption or preference was seen in any other groups except "postpartum" + {IMI} and a decrease in sucrose preference only in the postpartum + {EB} group from mid-'pregnancy' to 'postpartum'. The {OVX} + {IMI} group had decreased sucrose consumption relative to {OVX} controls, suggesting a negative effect of imipramine on sucrose consumption. Together, these results suggest an important, though complex, role for gonadal hormones in the behavioral changes accompanying this model of depression. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Chronic pain in adults has been associated with early-life stress. To examine the pronociceptive effect of early-life stress, we evaluated cutaneous and muscle nociception and activity in muscle nociceptors in an animal model of neonatal stress, limited bedding, in the rat. In this neonatal limited bedding ({NLB)} model, litters are exposed to limited bedding between postnatal days 2 and 9, and controls to standard bedding. In adult {NLB-treated} rats, mechanical nociceptive threshold in skeletal muscle was significantly lower (∼22\%) than in controls. Furthermore, administration of prostaglandin E 2 in skin as well as muscle produced markedly prolonged hyperalgesia, an effect prevented by spinal intrathecal injection of oligodeoxynucleotide antisense to protein kinase C ({PKC)}, a second messenger in nociceptors that has been implicated in the induction and maintenance of chronic pain. In electrophysiological studies, mechanical threshold of muscle nociceptors was reduced by ∼31\% and conduction velocity significantly increased (∼28\%). These findings indicate that neonatal stress induces a persistent hyperalgesia and nociceptor sensitization manifest in the adult and that the second messenger {PKC} may be a target against which therapies might be directed to treat a chronic pain syndrome that is associated with early-life traumatic stress. © 2011 International Association for the Study of Pain.

	abstract = {Hypoxia-ischemia ({HI)} is a common cause of neonatal brain damage with lifelong morbidities in which current therapies are limited. In this study, we investigated the effect of neuropeptide {NAP} ({NAPVSIPQ)} on early cerebral oxidative stress, long-term neurological function and brain injury after neonatal {HI.} Seven-day-old rat pups were subjected to an {HI} model by applying a unilateral carotid artery occlusion and systemic hypoxia. The animals were randomly assigned to groups receiving an intraperitoneal injection of {NAP} (3. μg/g) or vehicle immediately (0 h) and 24 h after {HI.} Brain {DNA} damage, lipid peroxidation and reduced glutathione ({GSH)} content were determined 24 h after the last {NAP} injection. Cognitive impairment was assessed on postnatal day 60 using the spatial version of the Morris water maze learning task. Next, the animals were euthanized to assess the cerebral hemispheric volume using the Cavalieri principle associated with the counting point method. We observed that {NAP} prevented the acute {HI-induced} {DNA} and lipid membrane damage and also recovered the {GSH} levels in the injured hemisphere of the {HI} rat pups. Further, {NAP} was able to prevent impairments in learning and long-term spatial memory and to significantly reduce brain damage up to 7 weeks following the neonatal {HI} injury. Our findings demonstrate that {NAP} confers potent neuroprotection from acute brain oxidative stress, long-term cognitive impairment and brain lesions induced by neonatal {HI} through, at least in part, the modulation of the glutathione-mediated antioxidant system. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

The present study tested whether a suppression of normal milk {PRL} intake by the pups during early postpartum period affects the subsequent level of activity of the tuberoinfundibular dopamine ({TIDA)} system. Maternal plasma and milk {PRL} levels were depressed in lactating rats by daily injections of bromocriptine. Such treatment during postpartum days 2-5, but not during postpartum days 9-12, resulted in a marked suppression of {DA} turnover in the median eminence ({ME)}, and in an elevation in plasma {PRL} concentration in the offspring when measured at 33-35 days of age. Simultaneous infusion of ovine {PRL} ({oPRL)} by osmotic minipump reversed the effects of neonatal bromocriptine. Catecholamine turnover in the neurointermediate lobe ({NIL)} was unaffected by any treatment. These results suggest that the normal activity of the {TIDA} system, but not that of the tuberohypophyseal {DA} system of the rat, may be impaired by a deficiency of {PRL} during a critical postpartum period.},

In the present study, we examined the potential antipsychotic effect of l-{SPD-A} in a phencyclidine ({PCP)-induced} rat model of schizophrenia. Pretreatment with l-{SPD-A} blocked acute {PCP-induced} hyperlocomotion and reversed prepulse inhibition ({PPI)} deficits. Chronic l-{SPD-A} administration (i.p., 10 mg/kg/day for 14 days) improved social interaction and novel object recognition impairments in rats that were pretreated with {PCP} (i.p., 5 mg/kg/day for 14 days). Moreover, in a conditioned avoidance response ({CAR)} test, l-{SPD-A}, with either i.p. or oral administration, significantly decreased active avoidance without affecting the escape response of rats. Importantly, compared to that of the parent compound l-{SPD}, l-{SPD-A} showed stronger suppression of {CARs.} Lastly, using a [{35S]GTPγS} binding assay, we demonstrated that l-{SPD-A} improved impaired dopamine D1 receptor function in the prefrontal cortex ({PFC)} in chronic {PCP-treated} rats. Taken together, these results indicate that l-{SPD-A} was not only effective against the hyperactivity, but also improved the sensorimotor gating deficit, social withdrawal and cognitive impairment in an animal model of schizophrenia.

Methods-We synthesised a peptide based on the amino-terminal domain of {SP-B} ({SP-B1-25)}, a full length {SP-B1-78}, and a full length palmitoylated {SP-C} peptide ({SP-C1-35)} and compared the in vivo function and sensitivity to plasma inhibition of preparations consisting of mixtures of phospholipids with {SP-B1-25} or {SP-B1-78} and/or {SP-C1-35} to Survanta. Preterm rabbits born at 27 days of gestation were treated at birth with surfactant and ventilated for 60 minutes. At 15 minutes half of them received plasma intratracheally. Dynamic compliance was monitored every 15 minutes and postmortem pressure-volume curves were measured to define lung mechanics. Results-Dynamic compliance and postmortem lung volumes were highest after treatment with a surfactant consisting of an {SP-B} peptide and {SP-C1-35} or Survanta. Plasma instillation decreased dynamic compliance and lung volumes sharply, but the most effective activity was by prior instillation of surfactants containing {SP-B1-25.} Conclusion-These experiments suggest that the N-terminal domain of {SP-B} ({SP-B1-25)} exhibits in vitro and in vivo surface activity and is relatively insensitive to plasma inhibition.},

In addition, the analgesic response induced by different morphine doses was determined in another group of rats. Basal latency was not different in deprived and control rats. Undernourished rats presented a significantly lower analgesic response in both stress situations. However, when the analgesic response induced by different morphine doses (1, 2, 4 and 8 mg/kg, s.c.) was assessed, a significantly higher response occurred in undernourished rats compared to control rats. This lower stress-induced analgesia in undernourished rats may account for the behavioural alterations attributed to early undernutrition.},

The fall in the cholesterol level is much smaller if rats are starved for 24 hours. This decrease can partly be inhibited by injections of glucagon. The only factor so far found to decrease blood cholesterol levels in suckling rats was starvation. Insulin, which slightly but significantly, depressed the level in 40 day old rats, increased it in suckling ones, as does prednisolone. It is concluded that blood cholesterol levels are more easily manipulated in suckling rats than in older rats, and that this is probably related to a different hormonal balance.},

We review here available experimental data on acute hypoxic fetoplacental vasoconstriction ({HFPV)} and on chronic hypoxic elevation of fetoplacental vascular resistance. The mechanism of {HFPV} includes hypoxic inhibition of potassium channels in the plasma membrane of fetoplacental vascular smooth muscle and consequent membrane depolarization that activates voltage gated calcium channels. This in turn causes calcium influx and contractile apparatus activation. The mechanism of chronic hypoxic elevation of fetoplacental vascular resistance is virtually unknown except of signs of the involvement of morphological remodeling.},

Prenatal {LPD} offspring had lower birth weights compared to normal-protein diet ({NPD)} offspring. Female prenatal and lactation stress ({PLS)} offspring from mothers fed an {LPD} developed abdominal adiposity and glucose intolerance associated with a 5-fold up-regulation of {NPY} {mRNA} and a 6-fold up-regulation of {Y2R} {mRNA} specifically in {VAT}, in addition to elevated platelet-rich-plasma ({PRP)} {NPY}, compared to control females fed a high-fat diet ({HFD).} Conversely, {PLS} male offspring showed lower {NPY} in {PRP}, a 10-fold decrease of {Y2R} {mRNA} in {VAT}, lower adiposity, and improved glucose tolerance compared to control males. Interestingly, prenatal {LPD} offspring cross-fostered to control lactating mothers had completely inverse metabolic and {NPY} phenotypes. Taken together, these findings suggested that maternal {LPD} activates the {VAT} {NPY-Y2R} system and increases abdominal adiposity and glucose intolerance in a sex- and time-specific fashion, suggesting that the peripheral {NPY} system is a potential mediator of programming for the offspring's vulnerability to obesity and metabolic syndrome. © {FASEB.}},

	volume = {85},
	abstract = {Binge eating disorder ({BED)} is characterized by intermittent, discrete periods of uncontrollable consumption during which huge quantities of high-fat food are eaten. The onset of {BED} occurs most frequently in adolescent or young adult females and is often associated with a history of dieting and psychological stress. Animal research suggests the importance of two synergistic factors in the aetiology of binge eating: a history of restriction-refeeding cycles (i.e., "yo-yo" dieting) and exposure to acute stress. In the rat, natural variations in maternal licking and grooming ({LG)} of pups during the first week of life are associated with long-lasting individual differences in offspring sensitivity to stress. The current set of experiments examined the effects of restriction-refeeding-footshock cycles on intake of highly palatable ({HP)} food in adolescent and adult female offspring of Low, Mid, and High {LG} dams. Following cycles of food restriction or unlimited food access, sated rats were exposed to footshock and their intake of {HP} food and chow was measured at 2, 4, and 22 h post-shock. Adolescent offspring of Low {LG} mothers displayed shock-induced binge eating, regardless of food-restriction history. In contrast, adolescent female offspring of Mid and High {LG} mothers failed to exhibit shock-induced increases in food intake. We saw no evidence of binge eating when shock was introduced in adulthood. The data suggest that low levels of maternal care in early life are associated with greater vulnerability to the later development of stress-related binge eating and further that this heightened vulnerability manifests during the adolescent period.

Prenatal exposure to alcohol in rats has also been shown to alter central nervous system ({CNS)} cholinergic function. Since cholinergic dysfunction disrupts spatial learning in normal rats, the present experiment assessed the role of putative prenatal alcohol-induced cholinergic dysfunction in spatial learning in rats. Pregnant rats were fed alcohol via liquid diet from gestation day 6 to 20. Control dams were pair-fed liquid diet without alcohol or fed ad lib lab chow and water. Group housed adult male and female offspring (postnatal days 110 to 135) were given scopolamine- {HCl} (0, 0.5, or 1.0 mg/kg/day) and tested in a Morris maze, with four trials per day for four days. A 15-s probe trial preceded testing on days 2-4. On day 5, the rats were given four trials to learn a new platform location. Scopolamine produced dose-dependent increases in latency to find the platform for all groups. There were no significant differences among prenatal treatment groups in scopolamine-induced shifts in performance. The results did not support the hypothesis that prenatal alcohol-induced {CNS} cholinergic dysfunction is related to spatial learning performance in these rats.},

The failure to find any significant differences between control and Cd exposed rats on either acquisition of reversal of a discrimination task could be interpreted as evidence that Cd has no effect on {CNS} function. Such a conclusion would be premature since the task was very easily acquired and may not have been sensitive enough to detect any subtle differences, or because Cd may have produced a deficit which could not be effectively assessed by the discrimination training.

	abstract = {Acute or short-term exposure to high doses of methylmercury ({MeHg)} causes a well-characterized syndrome that includes sensory and motor deficits. The environmental threat from {MeHg}, however, comes from chronic, low-level exposure, the consequences of which are poorly understood. Selenium (Se), an essential nutrient, both increases deposition of mercury (Hg) in neurons and mitigates some of {MeHg's} neurotoxicity in the short term, but it is unclear whether this deposition produces long-term adverse consequences. To investigate these issues, adult Long-Evans rats were fed a diet containing 0.06 or 0.6 ppm of Se as sodium selenite. After 100 days on these diets, the subjects began consuming 0.0, 0.5, 5.0, or 15 ppm of Hg as methylmercuric chloride in their drinking water for 16 months. Somatosensory sensitivity, grip strength, hindlimb cross (clasping reflex), flexion, and voluntary wheel-running in overnight sessions were among the measures examined. {MeHg} caused a dose- and time-dependent impairment in all measures. No effects appeared in rats consuming 0 or 0.5 ppm of Hg. Somatosensory function, grip strength, and flexion were among the earliest signs of exposure. Selenium significantly delayed or blunted {MeHg's} effects. Selenium also increased running in unexposed animals as they aged, a novel finding that may have important clinical implications. Nerve pathology studies revealed axonal atrophy or mild degeneration in peripheral nerve fibers, which is consistent with abnormal sensorimotor function in chronic {MeHg} neurotoxicity. Lidocaine challenge reproduced the somatosensory deficits but not hindlimb cross or flexion. Together, these results quantify the neurotoxicity of long-term {MeHg} exposure, support the safety and efficacy of Se in ameliorating {MeHg's} neurotoxicity, and demonstrate the potential benefits of Se during aging.

	abstract = {Purpose: In this study we evaluated the effects of undernourishment and seizures on memory and spatial learning in a model of developing brain. Experimental procedures: Male Wistar rat pups were allocated to one of six experimental groups: nourished control ({NC)}, nourished recurrent seizures ({NRS)}, nourished status epilepticus ({NSE)}, undernourished control ({UC)}, undernourished recurrent seizures ({URS)} or undernourished status epilepticus ({USE).} The {UC}, {URS} and {USE} groups were maintained on a starvation regimen from postnatal day 2 (P2) to postnatal day 15 (P15). {URS} and {NRS} groups suffered three daily Flurothyl-induced seizures from P2 to P4. The {USE} and {NSE} groups suffered a status epilepticus ({SE)} on P15. Beginning on P21 all groups were trained in the Morris water maze. At P30 the animals were sacrificed and their brains weighed. Results: Our data indicate that early undernourishment does not alter seizure susceptibility at P15, but diminishes body and brain weight (p{\textless}0.001), whereas seizures diminish body (p{\textless}0.001) but not brain weight (p=0.972). In the Morris water probe test we have observed that undernourished rats spent less time in the target quadrant than nourished animals (p{\textless}0.001). Also, rats submitted to recurrent seizures and rats submitted to status epilepticus spent less time in the target quadrant than seizure-free animals (p=0.001). There was a significant interaction between undernourishment and seizure (p=0.013). Discussion: Our findings show that undernourishment and seizures have an additive detrimental effect on body and brain weight as well as on spatial memory. © 2010 {ISDN.}},

	abstract = {It has been proposed that fetal exposure to environmental stressors, such as undernutrition, during critical periods of development may lead to adaptations that permanently change the structure and function of the body. These adaptations may be important for immediate survival during fetal development, but can predispose to disease in later life. We designed a pilot study investigating the effect of fetal undernutrition on the obesity-related peptides adiponectin, ghrelin, leptin and resistin levels in rat. We also wanted to explore changes in lipid and insulin metabolism. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to three dietary treatment groups on day 4 of gestation. The control group was fed ad libitum and the food-restricted rats received either 75\% or 50\% of ad libitum food intake until parturition. Serum levels of obesity-related peptides as well as lipid and insulin levels were measured from 1-month-old pups. Serum resistin concentrations were higher in both food-restricted groups and serum adiponectin concentration was lower in the 50\% food-restricted group compared to the control group. Serum total cholesterol levels were significantly higher in both food-restricted groups. These results indicate that undernutrition during fetal development may lead to unfavorable changes in obesity-related peptide hormones as well as evoking adverse changes in serum cholesterol levels. The observed changes may predispose to insulin resistance and significantly increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease in later life. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Marijuana consumption during adolescence has been proposed to be a stepping-stone for adult cocaine addiction. However, experimental evidence for this hypothesis is missing. In this work we chronically injected male and female Wistar rats with either the cannabinoid agonist {CP} 55,940 ({CP;} 0.4 mg/kg) or its corresponding vehicle. Adult acquisition (seven 30 min daily sessions) and maintenance (fourteen 2 h daily sessions) of cocaine self-administration (1 mg/kg), food-reinforced operant learning under conditions of normal (ad libitum access to food), and high motivation (food-restriction schedule) were measured. Additionally, brain metabolic activity was analyzed by means of [F-18]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. During the acquisition phase, female {CP-treated} rats showed a higher rate of cocaine self-administration as compared to vehicle-treated females and males; no differences were found between both male groups. This effect disappeared in the maintenance phase. Moreover, no differences among groups were evident in the food-reinforced operant task, pointing to the cocaine-specific nature of the effect seen in self-administration rather than a general change in reward processing. Basal brain metabolic activity also changed in {CP-treated} females when compared to their vehicle-treated counterparts with no differences being found in the males; more specifically we observed a hyper activation of the frontal cortex and a hypo activation of the amygdalo-entorhinal cortex. Our results suggest that a chronic exposure to cannabinoids during adolescence alters the susceptibility to acquire cocaine self-administration, in a sex-specific fashion. This increased susceptibility could be related to the changes in brain metabolic activity induced by cannabinoids during adolescence.},

	abstract = {Vasoactive intestinal peptide ({VIP)} is a regulator of rodent ernbryogenesis during the period of neural tube closure. {VIP} enhanced growth in whole cultured mouse embryos; treatment with a {VIP} antagonist during embryogenesis inhibited growth and development. {VIP} antagonist treatment during embryogenesis also had permanent effects on adult brain chemistry and impaired social recognition behavior in adult male mice. The neurological deficits of autism appear to be initiated during neural tube closure and social behavior deficits are among the key characteristics of this disorder that is more common in males and is frequently accompanied by mental retardation. The current study examined the blockage of {VIP} during embryogenesis as a model for the behavioral deficits of autism. Treatment of pregnant mice with a {VIP} antagonist during embryonic days 8 through 10 had no apparent effect on the general health or sensory or motor capabilities of adult offspring. However, male offspring exhibited reduced sociability in the social approach task and deficits in cognitive function, as assessed through cued and contextual fear conditioning. Female offspring did not show these deficiencies. These results Suggest that this paradigm has usefulness as a mouse model for aspects of autism as it selectively impairs male offspring who exhibit the reduced social behavior and cognitive dysfunction seen in autism. Furthermore, the study indicates that the foundations of some aspects of social behavior are laid down early in mouse embryogenesis, are regulated in a sex specific manner and that interference with embryonic regulators such as {VIP} can have permanent effects on adult social behavior.

Morphologists know that the jaw mechanism of early amphibians allowed them to perceive vibration through the substrate as their large heads lay on the ground. Although the exact mechanism of vibration production and the precise nature of the wave produced are not always understood, recent technical advances have given answers to increasingly sophisticated questions about how animals send and receive signals through the substrate. Some of us have been forced to explore the use of vibration when all other attempts to manipulate animals in the field have failed, while others began to think about vibration to explain some of the puzzling behaviors of species they were studying in other contexts. It has thus become clear that the use of vibration in animal communication is much more widespread than previously thought. We now know that vibration provides information used in predator-prey interactions, recruitment to food, mate choice, intrasexual competition and maternal/brood social interactions in a range of animals from insects to elephants.},

	abstract = {In two experiments with 160 female Sprague-Dawley rats the influence of various dietary riboflavin supplementations during lactation and during pregnancy and lactation were examined on food intake, body mass, reproduction, hematologic profile and the erythrocyte glutathione reductase activity coefficient ({EGR-AC).} In the first trial rats were fed a semisynthetic, riboflavin-deficient diet, based on casein and corn starch with various riboflavin supplementations during lactation (0, 2, 4, 6, 8 10, 12, 40, 400, 4000 mg riboflavin/kg diet). In the second experiment the rats received supplements of 1 and 20 mg riboflavin/kg diet, respectively, during pregnancy. After parturition each group was divided into three sub-groups with riboflavin supplementations during lactation of 1, 5 and 20 mg/kg diet, respectively. Both investigations ended at the 14th day of lactation. Food intake was decreased significantly by 25 \% and 11 \% in the groups without riboflavin supplementation or 1 mg riboflavin/kg diet. In the same groups body mass was reduced by 11 \% and 4 \%, respectively. With regard to the reproduction parameters the riboflavin supply influenced only the litter mass at the 14th day of lactation and only lactational supply was relevant. In both trials the results of the hematologic profile showed no differences. In riboflavin deficiency (0 or 1 mg riboflavin/kg diet, respectively) the {EGR-AC} was increased significantly to 1.9 and 1.8, respectively. At the supplementation of 4-5 mg riboflavin/kg diet {EGR-AC} reached a plateau of 1.45, which was not improved by higher supplements. Concerning the whole reproduction cycle (trial {II)} there was a stronger influence of the actual lactation-supply on {EGR-AC}, on the other hand a riboflavin deficiency in pregnancy could be compensated only partially by an optimal supply in lactation. Therefore, based on the parameter {EGR-AC} an optimal riboflavin supply is recommended for each part of the reproduction cycle. By means of {EGR-AC} also the riboflavin requirement for lactating rats was derived. Feeding a semisynthetic diet (17.4 {MJ} {ME/kg} {DM}, 20,8 \% crude protein in {DM)} a supplementation of 5-6 mg riboflavin/kg or a total content of 6-7 mg/kg diet is recommended.},

	volume = {82},
	abstract = {This study utilized a novelty-induced suppression of feeding task to examine anxiety-like behaviour and the anxiolytic effects of the 5-{HT1A} agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-{OH-DPAT)}, in rats prenatally exposed to ethanol. Adult offspring from ethanol exposed (E), pair-fed control ({PF)} and ad libitum-fed control (C) dams were habituated to a novel palatable food for 21 days and measures of baseline feeding obtained. On day 22 (d 22), animals received either 8-{OH-DPAT} (0.06 mg/kg) or vehicle (0.9\% {NaCl)} and feeding behaviour in the home cage or a novel cage was observed. Factor analyses revealed that feeding behaviour on d 21 (habituation) and d 22 (test day) are reflective of two different affective states, and that the single factor that emerged for novel cage testing on d 22 likely reflects the anxiety evoked by the novel test condition. Analyses of variance on the variables loading significantly onto the factors support the suggestion that the novel environment is anxiogenic for both females and males, and that 8-{OH-DPAT} acts as an anxiolytic. However, although both females and males showed alterations in behaviours (latency, amount, duration of feeding) reflective of anxiety, 8-{OH-DPAT} had anxiolytic effects primarily in females. Importantly, prenatal ethanol exposure altered several aspects of behavior in this task. Both E females and males consumed less than their control counterparts on d 21, suggesting a possible delay or deficit in response habituation. During home cage testing on d 22, overall feeding rate was slower in E than in C females, and E males consumed less than {PF} and C males. In addition, a smaller percentage of E than {PF} and C females fed in the novel environment, and latency to feed was significantly increased in E compared to control females. These findings indicate that prenatal ethanol exposure results in increased anxiety-like behaviour in adulthood, and that prenatal ethanol-induced hyponeophagia may be, at least in part, mediated by the 5-{HT1A} receptor. This study is one of the first to demonstrate specific increases in anxiety-like behaviour in animals prenatally exposed to ethanol, and further supports the utility of the novelty-induced suppression of feeding task in assessing anxiety and the effectiveness of anxiolytic agents.

	volume = {55},
	abstract = {Early life stress has been linked to the etiology of mental health disorders. Rodent models of neonatal maternal separation stress frequently have been used to explore the long-term effects of early stress on changes in affective and cognitive behaviors. However, most current paradigms risk metabolic deprivation, due to prolonged periods of pup removal from the dam. We have developed a new paradigm in {Balb/CByJ} mice, that combines very brief periods of maternal separation with temperature stress to avoid the confound of nutritional deficiencies. We have also included a within-litter control group of pups that are not removed from the dam. The present experiments provide an initial behavioral characterization of this new model. We show that neonatally stressed mice display increased anxiety and aggression along with increased locomotion but decreased exploratory behavior. In contrast, littermate controls show increased exploration of novelty, compared to age-matched, colony-reared controls. Behavioral changes in our briefly stressed mice substantially concur with the existing literature, except that we were unable to observe any cognitive deficits in our paradigm. However, we show that within litter control pups also sustain behavioral changes suggesting complex and long-lasting interactions between different environmental factors in early postnatal life. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE:} To establish the selenium (Se) deficient animal model on F344 inbred line rats and observe the effects of a long-term Se-deficiency on the offspring's neuro-behavior, abilities of learning and memory. {METHODS:} Feeding F344 inbred line rats on Se-deficient diet to establish Se-deficient animal model. For the offspring, the body weight, physiological indexes nervous reflections for growth and development were monitored during the early postnatal period. {RESULTS:} The Se-deficient diet contained less than 0.01 mg/kg and the glutathione peroxidase ({GSH-Px)} activity in blood of the Se-deficient group rats is lower than the Se-normal group after feeding on Se-deficient diet for 4 weeks. For the offspring, the birth weight and the body weight of Se-deficient group were obviously lower than the Se-normal group before weaning. Se-deficient offspring rats differed from Se-normal controls in lower scores in surface righting reflex ({RR)} test at postnatal 4th day after delivery, cliff avoidance test at postnatal 7th day and auditory acuity trial at postnatal 10th day respectively. But these differences disappear after a few days in the same tests. In addition, no significant differences between two groups in suspending test and walking ability test at postnatal 12th and 14th day. In open field test, Se-deficient male offspring stayed less time in the middle grid and moved less. In Morris water maze test, the Se-deficient offspring spent more time to find the hidden platform at the 6th and 9th training tests in the place navigation trial. Furthermore, the Se-deficient group spent less time in target quadrant when giving the spatial probe trial. {CONCLUSION:} A Se-deficient animal model have been established on F344 inbred line rats successfully. A long-term Se deficiency could retard the development of the offspring in uterus and after delivery. Se deficiency also decreased the offspring's abilities of spatial learning and memory in Morris water maze test and resulted in the male offspring's nervousness to new stimulant.},

	abstract = {Duodenal active calcium transport and longitudinal bone growth rate have been shown previously to be regulated in parallel by alteration of gonadal hormone status in sexually maturing female rats. The present study was designed to extend these observations to the sexually maturing male rat. Male rats were orchidectomized ({ORX)} and given Silastic implants containing either testosterone or estradiol at 6 weeks of age. At 9 weeks of age, duodenal active calcium transport was measured by the everted gut sac method and longitudinal bone growth rate was determined by tetracycline labeling. Decreases in body weight, longitudinal bone growth rate, duodenal calcium transport, and serum Ca and P were exhibited by {ORX} animals as compared with age-matched control animals. Testosterone administration to {ORX} animals resulted in an increase in body weight, longitudinal bone growth rate, duodenal calcium transport, and serum Ca and P as compared with {ORX} animals to a level not significantly different from that of age-matched control animals. Estradiol administration to {ORX} animals resulted in an additional decrease in body weight, although no significant effect on duodenal calcium transport, serum Ca, or P was noted as compared with {ORX} animals. There were no statistically significant alterations in the circulating levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, parathyroid hormone, or osteocalcin in response to any of the experimental manipulations of gonadal status. These results indicate that, as in the female, gonadal hormone status affects intestinal calcium transport in sexually maturing male rats in parallel with changes in bone growth rate by mechanisms that are independent of circulating levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.},

Polyamine synthesis is rate limited by ornithine decarboxylase ({ODC)} and {ODC} activity is specifically inhibited by -difluoromethyl ornithine ({DFMO).} To assess the importance of polyamines in adaptive growth we first measured mucosal polyamine profiles at different sites in the normal rat intestine and compared the results with those obtained in adaptive hypoplasia (seven days parental nutrition, {TPN)}, in the adaptive hyperplasia of two weeks after 90\% small bowel resection ({SBR)} or pancreatico biliary diversion ({PBD).} We then examined the effects of {DFMO} (2\% in drinking water, daily from two days before surgery) on the polyamine concentrations and the adaptive response to {PBD.} The hyperplasia of {SBR} and {PBD} was associated with increases in all the polyamine concentrations particularly putrescine. {TPN} induced a modest degree of hypoplasia and little change in polyamine synthesis resulting in subnormal polyamine concentrations and significantly inhibited the mucosal adaptive response. Changes in polyamine metabolism are important in intestinal mucosal adaptation and by controlling these changes adaptive growth can be controlled.},

The present study was designed to determine if these 2 effects necessarily occurred together and were brought about by the same period of restriction. Restriction of food intake of the dams during pregnancy alone produced progeny with low birth weight, which led to a slight permanent stunting and impaired learning ability. Restriction of the food intake of mothers during the lactation period produced progeny with severe permanent growth stunting, higher feed intake per unit metabolic mass than the normal progeny, but normal learning ability as measured by elevated T maze. It is concluded that these findings demonstrate a dissociation between growth stunting and behavior aberrations in the offspring. The occurrence and type of damage depend on the period in which dietary restriction is imposed on the mother.},

	title = {Behaviour of postnatally growth-impaired mice during malnutrition and after partial weight recovery},
	volume = {16},
	abstract = {Objectives: Early malnutrition is a highly prevalent condition in developing countries. Different rodent models of postnatal early malnutrition have been used to approach the subject experimentally, inducing early malnutrition by maternal malnutrition, temporal maternal separation, manipulation of litter size or the surgical nipple ligation to impair lactation. Studies on the behaviour of (previously) malnourished animals using animal models have produced sometimes contradictory results regarding the effects of early postnatal malnutrition and have been criticized for introducing potential confounding factors. The present paper is a first report on the behavioural effects of early malnutrition induced by an alternative approach: mice nursed by α-casein-deficient knockout dams showed a severe growth delay during early development and substantial catch-up growth after weaning when compared with animals nursed by wild-type females. Methods: Established behavioural tests were used to study the consequences of early postnatal malnutrition on mouse pups at weaning and after partial weight recovery. Results: Despite the impaired growth, the only behavioural difference between malnourished and normally growing animals was found in exploratory behaviour during acute malnutrition at the time of weaning. After partial catch-up in weight early protein malnourished animals showed no indication of lasting effects on general activity, emotionality and exploration, memory, and pain reactivity. Discussion: These results suggest that the role of early nutrition on behavioural development after recovery in animal models may have been overestimated. Further careful examination of this animal model in terms of maternal care and offspring behaviour will be necessary to confirm if mice nursed by α-casein-deficient dams offer an alternative to existing models while eliminating potential confounding factors.},

Despite their gross lack of social experience, isolation-reared subjects did not exhibit a deficit in frequencies of rough-and-tumble play. It is concluded that the fundamental motivation for rough-and-tumble play is relatively independent of prior learning in rats. Indeed, their elevated dorsal contacts suggested that isolation-raised subjects may have higher appetitive motivation for play. In Experiment 2, the levels of social motivation were compared between family- and isolation-raised animals, using a T-maze. The isolation-raised animals made reliably more choices for social interaction reward over food reward than family-raised animals. Although inconclusive, the results from the two experiments suggest that prolonged social isolation increases the appetitive motivation for social play.},

Active fragments of neurotrophic factors release by astrocyte under the stimulation of vasoactive intestinal peptide, {NAPVSIPQ} ({NAP)} and {SALLRSIPA} ({SAL)} respectively, have shown therapeutic potential for developmental delay and learning deficits. Previous work demonstrated that {NAP+SAL} prevent developmental delay and glial deficit in {Ts65Dn} that is a well-characterized mouse model for Down syndrome. The objective of this study is to evaluate if prenatal treatment with these peptides prevents the learning deficit in the {Ts65Dn} mice. Pregnant {Ts65Dn} female and control pregnant females were randomly treated (intraperitoneal injection) on pregnancy days 8 through 12 with saline (placebo) or peptides ({NAP} 20 μg {+SAL} 20 μg) daily. Learning was assessed in the offspring (8-10 months) using the Morris Watermaze, which measures the latency to find the hidden platform (decrease in latency denotes learning). The investigators were blinded to the prenatal treatment and genotype. Pups were genotyped as trisomic (Down syndrome) or euploid (control) after completion of all tests. Statistical analysis: two-way {ANOVA} followed by Neuman-Keuls test for multiple comparisons, P{\textless}0.05 was used to denote statistical significance. Trisomic mice who prenatally received placebo (Down syndrome -placebo; n = 11) did not demonstrate learning over the five day period. {DS} mice that were prenatally exposed to peptides (Down syndrome-peptides; n = 10) learned significantly better than Down syndrome -placebo (p{\textless}0.01), and similar to control-placebo (n = 33) and control-peptide (n = 30). In conclusion prenatal treatment with the neuroprotective peptides ({NAP+SAL)} prevented learning deficits in a Down syndrome model. These findings highlight a possibility for the prevention of sequelae in Down syndrome and suggest a potential pregnancy intervention that may improve outcome.},

	abstract = {Populations of ship rats (Rattus rattus) and Norway rats (R. norvegicus) were sampled over the five years 1983-87 at Pureora Forest Park, by Fenn and rat kill-traps every three months. Fenn and rat traps recorded similar capture rates in comparable habitats, although Fenns caught more heavy and fewer young rats. Ship rats (n = 1793 collected) were more abundant, heavier and larger in native forest, regardless of logging history, than in exotic forest of any age. Young ship rats (age classes 1-3) were most abundant in unlogged interior native forest, and in autumn and winter after summer and autumn breeding. Capture rates declined after peaking in 1985, probably due to reduced recruitment of young rats following lower pregnancy rates in adult females. The irregular annual seasonal cycle of reproduction and abundance observed at Pureora is the same as that described for non-commensal ship rat populations elsewhere in New Zealand and the world. Thirty five of 43 Norway rats collected came from a single trap by the Waipapa Stream, apparently set near a permanent colony. Pregnant female Norway rats were trapped in every season, suggesting year-round breeding. This implies that both species can recover rapidly after control operations conducted at any time of year, but especially in spring and summer. Future research should include manipulative exploration of factors limiting ship rat abundance and Norway rat distribution.},

	volume = {93},
	abstract = {Both genetic and epigenetic factors, such as abnormal hemodynamics, affect cardiac morphogenesis and the pathogenesis of congenital heart disease. Diastolic function is an important determinant of cardiac function, and tools for evaluating diastolic function in the embryo would be very valuable for assessment of cardiac performance. Using histological measurements of ventricular myoarchitecture, Doppler assessment of ventricular inflow velocities, and direct measurement of ventricular pressure, we investigated developmental changes of ventricular diastolic function in the mouse embryos from embryonic days 9.5 to 19.5. Regression analysis showed that peak velocity of A wave (an index of passive compliance) correlated with the area of trabecular myocardium in right ventricle ({RV)} (r2=0.92, P\&lt;0.0001) and left ventricle ({LV)} (r2=0.93, P\&lt;0.0001). Peak velocity of E wave (an index of active relaxation) exponentially correlated with the area of compact myocardium in {RV} (r2=0.98, P\&lt;0.0001) and {LV} (r 2=0.97, P\&lt;0.0001). We used these techniques to analyze {FOG-2} null embryos. {FOG-2} null embryos had thin compact myocardium, higher {EDP} and {E/A} ratio, smaller -{dP/dt}, and diminished sucking pressure than wild-type littermates, indicating that decreased ventricular diastolic function might be the primary cause of embryonic lethality. In conclusion, during embryogenesis the development of compact myocardium tightly regulates the development of ventricular distensibility. Our study in normal mice forms the basis for future studies of embryonic cardiac function in genetically manipulated mice with abnormalities of the cardiovascular system.},

	volume = {59},
	abstract = {We investigated the behavioral and neurochemical features of Fischer 344 strain rats in which a depressive state was induced by repeated handling and saline injections as a mild stressor. The repeated intraperitoneal injections of saline (2 ml/kg, twice a day for 14 days) elicited a moderate suppression of body weight gain, a decrease in their open field activity and a prolonged immobility in the tail suspension test. In the stress-exposed rats, the tissue content of norepinephrine ({NE)} was increased in the cerebral cortex and hypothalamus, whereas that of dopamine or serotonin was not affected. Although the stress exposure did not affect the binding properties of either the alpha-1 or beta adrenoceptors, it suppressed {cAMP} formation stimulated by {NE}, but not by isoproterenol or forskolin, in the cerebral cortical slices. In the presence of prazosin or phorbol ester, the difference in {NE-stimulated} {cAMP} formation between the control and the stress groups was totally abolished. Phenylephrine enhanced isoproterenol-stimulated {cAMP} formation in the control but not in the stress group. From these results, it is postulated that the alpha-1 potentiation of beta adrenoceptor-stimulated {cAMP} formation was attenuated in the stress group. These findings suggest that the manipulation of mild stressor with repeated handling and saline injections to Fischer 344 rats elicits a depressive state characterized by the behavioral changes and the attenuated alpha-1 potentiation in the cerebral cortex, and that this manipulation might be available for the study of the stress-induced depressive state as a generally acceptable mild stress model.},

The pups borne were subjected to spatial discrimination learning, and retention of the learning acquisition after an interval of one week, in a single unit black/white T-maze, at 8-9 weeks of age.

Prenatally administered diazepam induced significant deficits in learning acquisition and subsequent retention of the discrimination task in pups culled from normally nourished dams. However, offsprings from diazepam administered undernourished dams exhibited less marked cognitive deficits, which may be attributable to the altered emotional reactivity of pups born to undernourished mothers. Prenatally administered diazepam also induced differential effects in stressed and non-stressed dam offsprings, though the effects were statistically insignificant. The results suggest that prenatal insults, in the form of undernourishment, stress and anxiolytic drugs, leaving a lasting imprint on cognitive behaviour of the offspring.

Dihydroergotoxine treatment facilitated the learning performance of rats in both the original and reversal learning tests. Nutritional, environmental and dihydroergotoxine treatments had no effect on the retention of the passive avoidance learning, both at 24 hr and 1 week intervals.

Prenatal undernutrition was induced in rat pups by restricting the mother's diet by 50\% during the entire gestation period, whereas postnatal undernutrition was induced in rat pups by restriction of their diet by rotating them between lactating and non- lactating maternalised females for 12hr each day during suckling period from 2nd day to 18th day after birth. At 2.5 to 3 months of age all the rat offsprings were subjected to (i) original and reversal discrimination learning, (ii) passive avoidance, and (iii) active avoidance and its retention tests. The results indicate that both pre- and post-natal undernutrition in rat pups caused significant deficits in original and reversal discrimination learning, retention of passive avoidance after one week retention interval, and retention of active of avoidance learning. However, both pre- and post-natal undernutrition did not show significant effect on acquisition of active avoidance and retention of passive avoidance after 24hr retention interval.},

	abstract = {Angelman syndrome ({AS)} is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by severe mental retardation, lack of speech, ataxia, susceptibility to seizures, and unique behavioral features such as easily provoked smiling and laughter and autistic features. The disease is primarily caused by deletion or loss-of-function mutations of the maternally inherited {UBE3A} gene located within chromosome 15q11-q13. The {UBE3A} gene encodes a 100 {kDa} protein that functions as ubiquitin ligase and transcriptional coactivator. Emerging evidence now indicates that {UBE3A} plays a very important role in synaptic function and in regulation of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. A number of animal models for {AS} have been generated to understand the disease pathogenesis. The most widely used model is the {UBE3A-maternal-deficient} mouse that recapitulates most of the essential features of {AS} including cognitive and motor abnormalities. This paper mainly discusses various animal models of {AS} and how these models provide fundamental insight into understanding the disease biology for potential therapeutic intervention.},

	volume = {17},
	abstract = {Objective. Epidemiological studies suggest that intrauterine growth restriction ({IUGR)} due to maternal undernutrition during pregnancy represents a major risk factor for hypertension and diabetes in adult age. However, placental insufficiency, rather than maternal malnutrition, is the main cause of {IUGR} in the Western world. We therefore studied the relationship between birth weight and adult blood pressure and glucose tolerance in an established animal model of placental insufficiency. Design. {IUGR} was induced by uterine artery ligation in pregnant rats and the offspring were studied at 3-4 months of age. Methods. In one subgroup of animals (n = 41, birth weight range 3.2-6.6 g) blood pressure was recorded over 72 h using telemetry and hypothalamic tissue levels of noradrenaline was measured. In another subgroup (n = 30, birth weight range 3.0-6.8 g) the activity of the sympathetic nervous system ({SNS)} was assessed by noradrenaline isotope dilution techniques and glucose tolerance determined by an intravenous glucose load. Results. Adult blood pressure was independent of birth weight. Haemodynamic responses of {IUGR} rats to moderate sound stress was unaltered. In male rats neither {SNS} activity, hypothalamic noradrenaline concentrations nor glucose tolerance was associated with birth weight. In contrast, {IUGR} in female rats was associated with increased {SNS} activity, elevated fasting blood glucose as well as lower insulin and higher glucose levels in response to a glucose load. Conclusion. {IUGR} is not linked to an elevated blood pressure at 3-4 months of age in this model. However, in female rats, {IUGR} is associated with increased {SNS} activity and impaired glucose tolerance in adult life.},

Congenital diaphragmatic hernia ({CDH)} is associated with lung hypoplasia, {FGF-10} deficiency, and postnatal {ASM} dysfunction. We hypothesized {ASM} dysfunction emerges in tandem with, and may contribute toward, the primordial lung hypoplasia that precedes experimental {CDH.} Spatial origin and frequency of {ASM} peristaltic waves were measured in normal and hypoplastic rat lungs cultured from day 13.5 of gestation (lung hypoplasia was generated by nitrofen dosing of pregnant dams). Longitudinal lung growth was assayed by bud counts and tracing photomicrographs of cultures. Coupling of lung growth and peristalsis was tested by stimulation studies using serum, {FGF-10}, or nicotine and inhibition studies with nifedipine or U0126 ({MEK1/2} inhibitor). In normal lung, {ASM} peristalsis is developmentally regulated: proximal {ASM} becomes quiescent (while retaining capacity for cholinergic-stimulated peristalsis). However, in hypoplastic lung, spontaneous proximal {ASM} activity persists. {FGF-10} corrects this aberrant {ASM} activity in tandem with improved growth. Stimulation and inhibition studies showed that, unlike normal lung, changes in growth or peristalsis are not consistently accompanied by parallel modulation of the other. {ASM} peristalsis undergoes {FGF-10-regulated} spatiotemporal development coupled to lung growth: this process is disrupted early in lung hypoplasia. {ASM} dysfunction emerges in tandem with and may therefore contribute toward lung hypoplasia in {CDH.} Copyright © 2006 the American Physiological Society.},

The present study was aimed at evaluating long-term changes in hypothalamopituitary-adrenocortical ({HPA)} axis function and in hedonic behavior in adult offspring prenatally stressed by maternal food restriction, with attention on possible gender differences. Adult offspring were blood sampled via a tail artery cannula. Prenatally stressed females had significantly higher adrenal weights compared to males. Plasma {ACTH} levels, which rose in response to acute stress induced by handling, were significantly higher in females compared to those in males. A similar pattern was found in plasma corticosterone. The rise in {ACTH} levels was more pronounced in prenatally stressed rats though the rise in corticosterone failed to be modified. Corticotropin releasing hormone ({CRH)} and proopiomelanocortin {mRNA} levels in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus and anterior pituitary, respectively, were found to be unchanged. The present experiments failed to reveal a decrease in hedonic behavior in prenatally stressed rats. In contrast, in male offspring a tendency to a higher sucrose preference was observed. These data together with observed changes in hormone and {CRH} {mRNA} levels indicate that the gestational stress used did not result in a depression-like state in adult offspring.},

Both groups showed a significant improvement in performance within the first test period thus masking any effects of fatigue. Control animals showed a further improvement in performance after the 2-week interval and only minimal signs of fatigue. Experimental animals failed to show any further improvement and also suffered a greater degree of fatigue. Females appeared to be less severely affected in their performance. Selective deficits in skeletal muscle weights were also found with fast muscle being the most severely affected. It was concluded that performance deficits resulting from early undernutrition were in part due to skeletal muscle changes as well as cerebellar disfunction previously observed. © 1979 Academic Press, Inc.},

Discussion: Maternal Zn restriction interacted with postnatal nutritional status, resulting in divergent effects on weight gain and insulin resistance.

Results demonstrate that C57 mice will work for and consume lar ge quantities of ethanol and that prenatal cocaine exposure increased the amounts ingested by both male and female mice. Prenatal-cocaine-exposed males also exhibited motor deficits as indicated by longer response duration times compared to controls. The consumption of large amounts of ethanol exacerbated the motor impairment in prenatal-cocaine males and revealed such deficits in cocaine females.

The present study evaluated the reproductive performance of mice carrying the ClockΔ19 mutation that were either melatonin deficient (ClockΔ19/Δ19) or had the capacity to synthesise melatonin reinstated (ClockΔ19/Δ19 + {MEL).} The ClockΔ19/Δ19 mice took 2-3 days longer to mate, and to subsequently deliver pups, than their control line. The melatonin-competent mutants had a smaller, but still significant (P\&lt;0.05), delay. The ClockΔ19 mutation resulted in smaller median litter sizes compared with control lines (seven v. eight pups; P \&lt; 0.05), whereas melatonin proficiency reversed this difference. Survival to weaning was 84\% and 80\% for the ClockΔ19/Δ19 and ClockΔ19/Δ19 + {MEL} lines, respectively, compared with 94-96\% for the two control lines. The ClockΔ19/Δ19 mutants became behaviourally arrhythinic in constant darkness but, despite this, seven of seven became pregnant when paired with males after at least 14 days of constant darkness (five of seven within 4 days of pairing). In the ClockΔ19/Δ19 + {MEL} mice, seven of 15 became arrhythmic in constant darkness but still became pregnant. The seven mice that free ran for at least 14 days in constant darkness with a period of 27.1 h also became pregnant. The present study has demonstrated that the ClockΔ19 mutation has significant, but subtle, effects on reproductive performance. The reintroduction of melatonin competency and/or other genes as a result of crosses with {CBA} mice reduced the impact of the mutation further. It would appear that redundancy in genes in the circadian system allows the reproductive cyclicity to persist in mice, albeit at a suboptimal level. © {CSIRO} 2004.},

The thiamin intake during gestation influenced significantly the thiamin levels in tissues of the dams and their offspring. However the observed dose-dependence remained only for the first days of lactation. The thiamin concentration in milk two days postpartum also reflected the nutritional thiamin status front the pregnant rats, in which the thiamin concentration raised continuously with the duration of the lactation cycle.

To begin to investigate the role of glucocorticoid receptors in this association, we determined the effects of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone (2 mg/kg), administered to pregnant rats on gestation days 6-8, on maternal behaviors and schizophrenia-relevant behaviors in the offspring. Dams receiving dexamethasone exhibited increased milk ejection bouts during nursing. Offspring of dexamethasone-treated dams ({DEX)} showed decreased juvenite social plays and a blunted acoustic startle reflex in adolescence and adulthood, effects that were predicted by frequency of milk ejections ill the dams. {DEX} offspring also showed increased prepulse inhibition of startle and reduced motor activity. effects not correlated with maternal behavior It is postulated that over-stimulation of receptors largeted by glucocorticoid in the placenta or other maternal tissues during early-gestation call lead to psychomotor mid social behavioral deficits in the offspring.

Prepulse inhibition was reduced by {MS} in both sexes but there was no additional effect of {CP55},940 treatment. Memory performance in the Y-maze and novel object recognition test was not affected by either of the two 'hits'.

First published September 25, 2009; doi:10.1152/ajpheart.01338.2008.-Adverse developmental environments can increase the risk of adult cardiovascular disease, but not all individuals are affected, suggesting the importance of genotype. Genetically distinct mouse strains allow the genetic dissection of complex traits; however, they have not been used to evaluate the developmental origins of adult cardiovascular disease. Our objective was to determine the effect of prenatal nutrient restriction (R) on adult cardiovascular function in {A/J} ({AJ)} and {C57BL/6J} (B6) mice and whether a postnatal high-fat ({HF)} diet exacerbates these effects. Pregnant {AJ} and B6 mice underwent a 30\% R or ad libitum diet, and their offspring underwent a {HF} or control diet. Hypertension (+17 {mmHg;} P {\textless} 0.001) was observed in {B6R} mice at 9 wk, and their arterial pressure tended to remain high at 25 wk (+13 {mmHg;} not significant). In {AJR} mice, the normal decrement in arterial pressure over this age range in this strain was abolished. Heart rate prematurely increased in {B6R} and decreased in {AJR} (all; P {\textless} 0.05) mice from 9 to 25 wk. There was no effect of postnatal {HF} diet on these relationships. The Tei index (from a 26-wk microultrasound) was increased in both {AJR} and {B6R} mice (all; P {\textless} 0.05), suggesting an improved global myocardial performance. Neither R nor {HF} alone changed diastolic (ratio of E wave to A wave) or systolic (\%fractional shortening) function in either strain; however, R and {HE} combined improved diastolic function in B6 (P {\textless} 0.05) but not in {AJ} mice. Therefore, there are strain-dependent alterations in adult cardiovascular function in response to prenatal nutrient restriction. Unexpectedly, a postnatal {HF} diet did not exacerbate the effects of prenatal nutrient restriction on postnatal cardiovascular outcomes.},

Mammary gland weight and composition on d 7 of lactation were not significantly affected by fasting for 24 h on d 1 of lactation or for 40 h on d 11-13 of pregnancy, except that {DNAt} was decreased slightly by the latter treatment. Milk yield (litter weight gain) was depressed markedly during fasting on d 1 of lactation, but thereafter recovered so that it was the same as controls between d 3 and 13 of lactation; after d 13 it fell once more. A 40 h fast on d 11-13 of pregnancy had no effect on milk yield. Thus, although normal mammary development was inhibited by starvation, the gland was subsequently able to compensate so that milk yield was not reduced.},

	abstract = {Adaptation to chronic hypoxia increases cardiac tolerance to acute ischemia/reperfusion injury, which manifests itself as a reduction of myocardial infarct size, improvement of post-ischemic contractile dysfunction and limitation of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Hearts of chronically hypoxic adult animals can be further protected by classic ischemic preconditioning but the effects of these two phenomena are not additive. It appears that adaptation to hypoxia does not increase the total capacity of endogenous protective mechanisms. Moreover, the antiarrhythmic threshold of preconditioning is increased in chronically hypoxic animals. Hearts of newborn animals which are "adapted" to hypoxic conditions in utero, are more tolerant to ischemia/reperfusion injury than adults and can be further protected neither by preconditioning nor by prenatal exposure to chronic hypoxia. Decreasing cardiac ischemic tolerance after birth can be prevented by postnatal exposure to chronic hypoxia. In the rat, preconditioning develops only during the first postnatal week; unlike in adults, combination of chronic hypoxia and preconditioning provides better protection than each of the two conditions alone. Although the detailed mechanism of cardioprotection induced by chronic hypoxia is unknown, several studies using selective pharmacological modulators of {mitoK(ATP)} suggest that activation of these channels plays an important role. Considering their involvement also in various forms of preconditioning, {mitoK(ATP)} may serve as the common component of both short-term and long-term cardioprotective mechanisms.},

Objective.: To investigate the role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in regulation of {IVD} development and organization. Summary of Background Data.: -catenin dependent Wnt signaling is one of the central regulators in cartilage development during limb skeletal formation. Little is known, however, about the physiologic relevance of this signaling pathway to {IVD} development and organization. Methods.: Temporal-spatial distribution of Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity was examined in {IVD} using Wnt/β-catenin reporter ({TOPGAL)} mice. The structural changes in the mouse {IVD} components such as the nucleus pulposus ({NP)}, endplate ({EP)}, annulus fibrosus ({AF)}, and the growth plate ({GP)} of the vertebral body were analyzed after transient activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling or deletion of β-catenin in the mice. Results.: Activity of Wnt/β-catenin signaling was high in {EP}, {AF}, and {GP} in the embryonic stages and decreased at the postnatal stage; it was undetectable in the embryonic {NP} but upregulated after birth. The transient activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling caused severe deterioration of the {GP} and the {AF}, whereas deficiency of β-catenin accelerated bone formation in between {EP} and {GP.} Conclusion.: The findings in this study suggest that proper regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling is required for development and organization of {IVD.} © 2011 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.},

	volume = {167},
	abstract = {There is significant interest in in vivo synaptic plasticity in mice due to the many relevant genetic mutants now available. Nevertheless, use of in vivo models remains limited. To date long-term potentiation ({LTP)} has been studied infrequently, and long-term depression ({LTD)} has not been characterized in the mouse in vivo. Herein we describe protocols and improved methodologies we developed to record hippocampal synaptic plasticity reliably from the dentate gyrus of the awake freely behaving mouse. Seven days prior to recording, we implanted microelectrodes encapsulated within a lightweight, low profile head stage assembly. On the day of recording, we induced either {LTP} or {LTD} in the awake freely behaving animal, and monitored subsequent changes in population spike amplitude for at least 24 h. Using this protocol we attained 80\% success in inducing and maintaining either {LTP} or {LTD.} Recording from a chronic implant using this improved methodology is best suited to reveal naturally occurring brain activity and avoids both acute effects of local electrode insertion and drifts in neuronal excitability associated with anesthesia. Ultimately a reliable freely behaving mouse model of bi-directional synaptic plasticity is invaluable for full characterization of genetic models of disease states and manipulations of the mechanisms implicated in learning and memory.

	abstract = {We demonstrated that neonatal isolation ({ISO)} increases acquisition of cocaine self-administration and alters psychostimulant-induced ventral striatal dopamine and serotonin levels in female rats. Both dopamine and serotonin modulate the behavioral effects of cocaine and these effects can vary across estrous stages. We now test whether {ISO} modifies the manner in which estrous stage affects the acute behavioral responses to cocaine. Litters were assigned to {ISO} (1 h/day isolation; post-natal days 2-9) or non-handled ({NH)} conditions. In Experiment 1, the ability of cocaine (0.3-30 mg/kg; {IP)} to disrupt schedule-controlled responding for food was assessed in proestrus, estrus, and diestrus stages. Diestrus and proestrus {NH} females showed increased response rates at low cocaine doses and decreased rates at higher doses relative to baseline. In contrast, estrus {NH} females showed decreased responding across all doses. {ISO} eliminated this estrous stage distinction; only decreased responding to high cocaine doses were seen. Yet, estrous cyclicity during food restriction (Experiment 2) did not differ by group. To confirm this {ISO} effect, proestrus or estrus rats were administered cocaine (0, 5, 10 mg/kg; {IP)} and activity monitored in Experiment 3. Locomotor activity differed by estrous stage in {NH} but not {ISO} rats. Cocaine plasma levels (Experiment 4) at the time of peak behavioral activity did not differ by group or estrous stage. Results extend prior studies to show estrous stage alters the behavioral effects of cocaine. Neonatal isolation eliminates these effects perhaps reflecting alterations in accumbens monoamine levels or the effects of estrogen on this system. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The present study was designed to examine the effects of these factors on the in vivo absorption of glucose and 3-O-methylglucose. Rats were fed either intraluminally or by total parenteral nutrition ({TPN)} for 7 days or fasted for 72 h. Sugar absorption was measured under pentobarbital sodium (Nembutal) anesthesia at concentrations from 7 to 28 {mM.} Luminally fed rats had a significantly greater mucosal mass and absorption rates per centimeter of both sugars than either {TPN} or fasted animals. However, {TPN} rats had significantly greater absorption per milligram protein (i.e., specific activity) for both glucose and 3-O-methylglucose than luminally fed rats. In addition, {TPN} rats absorbed significantly more glucose per milligram protein, but not 3-O-methylglucose, than fasted animals. These data indicate: 1) luminal nutrients maintain glucose absorption by their trophic effects on mucosal mass; 2) the increase in specific activity for sugar absorption after {TPN} is unrelated to caloric balance; and 3) intestinal glucose metabolism affects its rate of absorption of glucose, but not 3-O-methylglucose.},

Data on litter size and composition, and birth weights were recorded for 117 first litters and 29 second litters of dams, which were impregnated during postpartum oestrus. Twelve pregnant and 13 non-pregnant dams, together with their litters and feeders, were weighed daily during lactation. Activity budgets were taken of 10 dams in each group. Pregnant dams increased their food intake and withdrew milk earlier than non-pregnant ones. In addition, postpartum-conceived litters contained significantly heavier and fewer pups at birth than first litters and the sex ratio shifted in favour of males. Since male house mouse embryos are known to suffer more severely than females from nutritional stress, it is concluded that the sex ratio variation is not due to energy shortage during concurrent pregnancy and lactation. Rather, it may attributed to adaptive maternal manipulation, because postpartum-conceived pups will be heavier at weaning than other ones and males might benefit more strongly from being heavy at weaning than females. Finally, pregnant dams devoted more time to maternal care than did non-pregnant ones during the last 6 days of lactation. This contradicts the results on milk yield, if a direct proportionality of nursing time and amount of ejected milk is assumed, but is in agreement with the expected differences in maternal motivation of the dams. © 1989.},

Details of postnatal development are provided, The dynamics of age structure was related to the patterns of reproduction. Longevity in the field was up to two years and in captivity it was more than three years, The species is relatively low habitat-specific: it only avoids rocks and occurs in all other habitats. The highest density (up to four individuals per 1 ha) was found in sand dunes. Habitat selection is seasonally variable and is determined by different environmental factors in different seasons, Pattern of individual space use is characterized by periodical strong territorial conservatism. Observations on radio-implanted M. crassus showed that an individual remained in close vicinity of its burrow during the entire night for a relatively long period. Then, it moved to another burrow where it stayed for three-seven nights, Jirds had relatively short periods of aboveground activity (5-10 \% of dark time); activity was restricted to the area under shrub canopy just near the burrow. All individuals were highly infested by fleas.

The administration of bromocriptine did not influence maternal plasma levels of prolactin, but fetal levels were decreased on day 22 of gestation. Oestradiol benzoate raised prolactin concentrations in maternal plasma on days 20 and 22, whereas fetal plasma levels were raised on day 22. This increase was counteracted by simultaneous administration of bromocriptine and {OB}, whereas impairment of fetal growth remained after treatment. A slight decline in fetal plasma levels of insulin was observed once, but thyroid content of triiodothyronine and thyroxine (T4) was decreased to a quarter and a third respectively of control levels in male and female fetuses of {OB-treated} rats, fetal circulating levels of T4 were also depressed. Maternal and fetal plasma glucose levels were decreased. A close correlation between T4 and placental or fetal weight was always present on day 22 of gestation. It was concluded that {OB} injected into pregnant rats will reach the fetal circulation as judged by increases in fetal plasma levels of prolactin. The observed fetal growth retardation after the {OB} injection was associated with thyroid deficiency, whereas plasma levels of prolactin and insulin were either not at all or only slightly altered. A direct effect of {OB} on placental blood flow and hence on the fetal food supply cannot, however, be excluded.},

We examined the effect of maternal food restriction during lactation on offspring in mice. From 1 to 21 days after parturition, control dams ({CDs)} were fed with the standard amounts of daily food consumption, whereas dietary restricted dams ({RDs)} received 70\% of daily food consumption. Although the mean body weight of {RDs} was not significantly different from that of the {CDs}, body weight of the offspring from {RD} ({RD} offspring) was significantly lower than that of the offspring from {CD} ({CD} offspring). The difference was detectable until 10 weeks of age. Body lengths and brain weights of {RD} offspring at postnatal day 22 were lower than those of the {CD} offspring. Plasma concentrations of leptin in {RD} offspring decreased significantly. But plasma concentrations of growth hormone and thyroxin were not different between the two groups. In the open field tests, total distance was significantly decreased in {RD} offspring compared with {CD} offspring. In the hole-board test, head dip latency was increased and the number of dips was decreased significantly in {RD} offspring. In the elevated plus maze test, total distance and risk assessment were significantly decreased in the {RD} offspring. There was no difference between the two groups in the rota-rod and wire-hang tests.

This paper uses data from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey ({CLHNS)} to explore an alternate strategy-the supply-demand model-as a means to model fetal nutritional sufficiency, adaptation and cardiovascular programming. Specifically, it is hypothesized that small size should be associated with elevated {CVD} risk, but only when there is corroborating evidence that the individual had a higher growth potential, was born to a nutritionally stressed mother, or both. Using low density lipoprotein cholesterol ({LDL-C)} and systolic blood pressure ({SBP)} as markers of {CVD} risk, the predictions of the model are only met for {LDL-C} and only in males. There is evidence for an association between maternal nutritional status and male offspring {SBP}, but this relationship is independent of fetal nutritional sufficiency as defined by the model. Thus, although both the {LDL-C} and {SBP} findings support the general hypothesis that the prenatal milieu has long-term implications for {CVD} risk in males, only the patterns observed for {LDL-C} are consistent with the prediction that fetal nutritional sufficiency is key to {CVD} programming.},

	abstract = {Background: Prenatal tobacco smoke exposure is associated with alterations in motivated behavior in offspring, such as increased consumption of highly palatable foods and abused drugs. Animal models show that gestational nicotine ({GN)} exposure mediates changes in responding for sucrose and drug reward. Methods: A novel, intermittent low-dose intravenous ({IV)} exposure model was used to administer nicotine (0.05 mg/kg/injection) or saline 3 x /day to rats on gestational days 8-21. Two experiments investigated the effect of {IV} {GN} on (1) the habituation of spontaneous locomotor activity and on (2) sucrose reinforced responding in offspring. For the operant experiments, animals acquired fixed-ratio ({FR-3)} responding for sucrose, 26\% (w/v), and were tested on varying concentrations (0, 3, 10, 30, and 56\%; Latin-square) according to a {FR-3}, and then a progressive-ratio ({PR)} schedule. Male and female adult offspring were used. Results: {IV} {GN} did not alter birth or growth weight, or the number of pups born. No between-group differences in habituation to spontaneous locomotor activity were observed. {FR} testing produced an inverted U-shaped response curve, and rats showed peak responding for 10\% sucrose reinforcement. Neither gestation nor sex affected responding, suggesting equivalent sensitivity to varying sucrose concentrations. {PR} testing revealed that {GN} rats showed greater motivation for sucrose reinforcement relative to controls. Conclusions: A low-dose, {IV} {GN} exposure model resulted in increased motivation to respond for sucrose reinforcement in adult offspring. This suggests that using a low number of cigarettes throughout pregnancy will result in increased motivation for highly palatable foods in adult, and perhaps, adolescent offspring.

	volume = {33},
	abstract = {Background: Rats prenatally exposed to ethanol (E) typically show increased hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ({HPA)} responses to stressors in adulthood. Importantly, prenatal ethanol may differentially alter stress responsiveness in male and female offspring, suggesting a role for the gonadal hormones in mediating the effects of ethanol on {HPA} activity. We investigated the role of ethanol-induced changes in hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal ({HPG)} activity in the differential {HPA} regulation observed in E compared to control females across the estrous cycle. Methods: Peripheral hormones and changes in central neuropeptide {mRNA} levels were measured across the estrous cycle in adult female offspring from E, pair-fed ({PF)} and ad libitum-fed control (C) dams. Results: Ethanol females showed normal estrous cyclicity (vaginal smears) but delayed sexual maturation (vaginal opening). Both {HPG} and {HPA} activity were differentially altered in E (and in some cases, {PF)} compared to control females as a function of estrous cycle stage. In relation to {HPG} activity, E and {PF} females had higher basal and stress estradiol (E2) levels in proestrus compared to other phases of the cycle, and decreased {GnRH} {mRNA} levels compared to C females in diestrus. Further, E females had greater variation in {LH} than {PF} and C females across the cycle, and in proestrus, only E females showed a significant {LH} increase following stress. In relation to {HPA} activity, both basal and stress {CORT} levels and overall {ACTH} levels were greater in E than in C females in proestrus. Furthermore, {AVP} {mRNA} levels were increased overall in E compared to {PF} and C females. Conclusions: These data demonstrate ethanol-induced changes in both {HPG} and {HPA} activity that are estrous phase-specific, and support the possibility that changes in {HPA} activity in E females may reflect differential sensitivity to ovarian steroids. E females appear to have an increased {HPA} sensitivity to E2, and a possible shift toward {AVP} regulation of {HPA} activity. That {PF} were similar to E females on some measures suggests that nutritional effects of diet or food restriction played a role in mediating at least some of the changes observed. © 2009 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.},

Deletion of both alleles of {CK2} alpha leads to mid-gestational embryonic lethality, while deletion of both alleles of {CK2} alpha' does not interfere with viability or development of embryos; however, adult {CK2} alpha'-/-males are infertile. To further elucidate developmental roles of {CK2}, and analyze functional overlap between the two catalytic genes, mice with combined knockouts were bred. Mice bearing any two {CK2} catalytic alleles were phenotypically normal. However, inheritance of a single {CK2} alpha allele, without either {CK2} alpha' allele, resulted in partial embryonic lethality. Such mice that survived through embryogenesis were smaller at birth than littermate controls, and weighed less throughout life. However, their cardiac function and lifespan were normal. Fibroblasts derived from {CK2} alpha+/-{CK2} alpha'-/- embryos grew poorly in culture.

Additionally, abnormalities of the mid- and hind-brain were observed and included stenosis of the cerebral aqueduct at the level of the isthmus and apparent absence of the organ progenitor for the cerebellar vermis. Although not previously directly linked to cholesterol deficiency in experimental animals, limb and external genital defects were a notable outcome in this multifactorially-based cholesterol deficiency model. The results of this study provide new evidence supporting an important role for cholesterol in early embryonic development, provide additional support for the hypothesis that this role may involve the function of specific gene products, such as sonic hedgehog (shh) signaling protein, and provide a description of the pathogenesis of some of the characteristic malformations in {SLOS.}},

We investigated the underlying mechanisms for the developmental change of {PTP} induced by {HFS} (100 Hz, 2 s) at postnatal days 4-6 and 9-11 at the rat calyx of Held synapse. Low-concentration tetraphenylphosphonium (2 {μM)}, an inhibitor of mitochondrial {Na+/Ca2+} exchanger, suppressed the amount of posttetanic residual Ca2+ and {PTP} to a larger extent at the immature calyx synapse, indicating a developmental reduction of mitochondrial contribution to {PTP.} The higher amount of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake during {HFS} and consequent posttetanic residual Ca2+ at the immature calyx of Held was associated with higher peak of {HFS-induced} Ca2+ transients, most likely because the mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake during {HFS} was supralinearly dependent on the presynaptic resting Ca2+ level. Probing into the contribution of {Na+/Ca2+} exchangers to Ca2+ clearance, we found a specific upregulation of the K+-dependent {Na+/Ca2+} exchanger ({NCKX)} activity in the mature calyx of Held. We conclude that the upregulation of {NCKX} limits the Ca2+ buildup and inhibits mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake during {HFS}, which in turn results in the reduction of posttetanic residual Ca2+ and {PTP} at the mature calyx of Held synapse. © 2013 the American Physiological Society.},

In a previous study (Jongen-Rêlo {AL}, Leng A, Luber M, Pothuizen {HHJ}, Weber L, Feldon J. The prenatal methylazoxymethanol acetate treatment: a neurodevelopmental animal model for schizophrenia? Behav Brain Res 2004;149:159-81) we have studied {MAM-treated} animals in a series of behavioural tests related to schizophrenia, such as latent inhibition and pre-pulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response to establish the validity of prenatal {MAM} treatment (20 mg/kg i.p. on gestational days 9-15; {MAM} 9-{MAM} 15). We found that, apart from a marginal effect of increased activity in the open field, the {MAM} treatment on gestational day 15 was behaviourally ineffective. Here, we extended our previous study to a water maze experiment conducted in the same batch of animals as presented previously ({MAM} 12-{MAM} 15). {MAM-treated} animals showed similar water maze performance compared with control animals during the acquisition phase and the probe tests. However, during the reversal phase, {MAM} 15 animals showed impaired acquisition of the new platform location. This might indicate some cognitive deficits in {MAM} 15 animals in terms of working memory or behavioural flexibility. However, in combination with the lack of behavioural abnormalities of {MAM} 12-{MAM} 15 animals in several other tests related to schizophrenia in the previously reported study, the use of {MAM} treatment ({MAM} 12-{MAM} 15) as a valid model for schizophrenia still remains debatable. © 2005 Elsevier {B.V.} All rights reserved.},

Since the {EC50} values of phenytoin 3 to 30 min after infusion did not differ, onset of anticonvulsant effect clearly occurred as soon as adequate brain concentrations were attained. Phenobarbital was effective 3 min after infusion, and although much higher free plasma levels were necessary, effective brain concentrations were similar to those of phenytoin.

Similar activation of brain angiotensin also increases thirst, so that the specificity of the precocious sodium intake remains undetermined. In this article we report experiments that dissociate neonatal renin-evoked sodium appetite and thirst, and establish the specificity of the appetite. Our findings confirm that sodium appetite can first be discerned at 3 days of age, and show that it rapidly develops until 12 days of age. During this developmental window, renin-evoked sodium appetite is dissociated from thirst because (a) {NaCl} is preferred to water, (b) the appetite develops faster than thirst, and (c) 3-day-old renin-stimulated pups will avidly lick dry {NaCl.} These results show that activation of brain angiotensin in the 3-day-old rat pup evokes a precocious and specific sodium appetite.},

The pup retrieval test and maternal observations were conducted during lactation to quantify maternal care. In the pup retrieval test, dams that were concurrently experiencing {CR} (i.e., from the lactation and lifelong groups) displayed shorter latencies to retrieve all pups than the control and preconception groups and the lactation group constructed better nests than all groups. Adult offspring were tested in three tests of anxiety: the elevated plus maze, open field, and emergence test. No differences were observed in the elevated plus maze; however, in the open field preconception animals made fewer entries and spent more time in the central zone than controls. In addition, preconception offspring exhibited longer latencies to full body emergence, spent less time fully emerged, and spent more time engaged in risk assessment behaviours than all other groups.

[Methods] {FGR} rat model was created by partial occlusion of bilateral artery on the 17th gestational week. The baby rats were randomly sub-divided into two groups; 10 in the experimental group and 10 in control group. Experimental group rats were fed with 100 mg lecithin daily for 40 days after birth. Then they were experimented with platform test, passive avoidance test and water maze test to evaluate the learning and memory of all the rats, and measure neuronal apoptosis in hippocampus. [Results] The radio of neuronal apoptosis in experimental group was significantly lower than that of control group, (2.2 ± {0.58)/HP} vs (5.08 ± {1.21)/HP} in the cortex, P {\textless} 0.01, and (0.59 ± {0.23)/HP} vs (1.71 ± {0.63)/HP} in the hippocampus, P {\textless} 0.01. Spatial learning and memory capacity were significantly increased in the experimental group (P {\textless} 0.01). [Conclusion] Adding lecithin to diet is helpful to neural development and improvement of spatial learning and memory. It also decreases the neuronal apoptosis in cortex and hippocampus.},

In the present study, we evaluated the effects of prenatal exposure to zymosan, a non-infectious and non-bacterial agent capable of inducing inflammation, on mean systolic arterial pressure ({MSAP)} in rat offspring at 6-66 weeks of age. 2. Pregnant rats were divided into three groups: (i) a control group, administered 0.5 {mL}, i.p., saline on gestation Days 8, 10 and 12; (ii) a zymosan-treated group, given 2.37 mg/kg, i.p., zymosan on gestation Days 8, 10 and 12; and (iii) a pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ({PDTC)} + zymosan-treated group, which was given 100 mg/kg, i.p., {PDTC} 1 h before zymosan. At 6, 16, 26, 36, 56 and 66 weeks of age, {MSAP} was determined in rat offspring from all three groups. Serum levels of tumour necrosis factor ({TNF)-alpha} were determined in dams, as well as in offspring at 24 and 56 weeks of age. In addition, protein levels of nuclear factor ({NF)-kappa} B (p65) in the myocardium and kidney of offspring were determined at 24 weeks of age. 3. The results showed that {MSAP} and {NF-kappa} B (p65) levels in the myocardium and kidney of offspring from the zymosan-treated group were increased significantly compared with control. This increase was inhibited by concomitant treatment with {PDTC.} Serum {TNF-alpha} levels in dams exposed to zymosan and in their offspring at 56 weeks of age (but not at 24 weeks of age) were significantly increased compared with levels in the control group. Following lipopolysaccharide treatment (1 mg/kg, i.p.) of adult rat offspring at 24 weeks of age, there was a further increase in serum {TNF-alpha} levels in offspring in the zymosan-treated group compared with the other two groups. 4. The findings of the present study suggest that non-bacterial inflammation during gestation can lead to hypertension in offspring and that {NF-kappa} B signalling may play a critical role in this process.},

In offspring at 32 wk of age, indirect calorimetry and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ({DEXA)} were performed to assess metabolic activity and body composition. Insulin sensitivity was assessed using a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp. At 3 d of age, male and female {LPD} offspring were 23 and 27\% smaller than controls, respectively. They remained significantly smaller throughout the experimental period (similar to 10\% smaller at 32 wk). Importantly, there was increased insulin sensitivity in {LPD} offspring (47\% increase in males and 38\% increase in females); pancreatic insulin content was normal. Body composition, O(2) consumption, respiratory exchange ratio ({RER)}, and locomotor activity were not different to controls. These findings suggest that in the absence of "catch-up" growth {IUGR} programs for improved insulin sensitivity. (Pediatr Res 70: 339-344, 2011)},

It has been hypothesized that species living in environments where food availability is unpredictable might become sexually mature at smaller sizes and channel excess energy into reproduction rather than into compensatory growth. We explored this hypothesis in female cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus) by feeding variable levels of dietary protein during early postweanling development (14-45 days of age) and monitoring compensatory growth and fitness after nutritional rehabilitation (45-100 days of age). Growth was optimum in females fed diets containing 16\% protein, with minimal requirements estimated to be 12\%. Females fed diets containing {\textless} 12\% protein exhibited suppressed development, including delayed puberty. However, these nulliparous females demonstrated compensatory growth during the early period of nutritional rehabilitation, regardless of the severity of previous restrictions in protein. No long-lasting fitness consequences from postweanling nutritional restrictions were apparent as we observed no difference in date of conception, body mass of dams at parturition, litter size, or rate of growth of neonates. We offer a possible adaptive explanation for this observed plasticity in growth and development.},

In this work, we investigated the mechanisms underlying mild obesity and the alteration of caloric balance. Neonatally manipulated mice become overweight after onset of maturity, showing increased fat tissue and hyper-trophic epididymal adipocytes. Increase in body weight occurs in the presence of a small increase in daily food intake (significant only in the adult period) and the absence of a decrease in spontaneous locomotor activity, while the calculated caloric efficiency is higher in manipulated mice, especially in adulthood. Fasting adult animals show hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia. and hyperleptinemia. Soon after weaning and in the adulthood. plasma corticosterone and adrenocorticotropin ({ACTH)} are also significantly increased. Thus, neonatal manipulations in nongenetically susceptible male mice program mild obesity, with metabolic and hormonal alterations that are similar to those found in experimental models of diabetes mellitus, suggesting that this metabolic derangement may have at least part of its roots early on in life and, more interestingly, that psychological and nociceptive stimuli induce these features.},

Our data indicate that the bone tissue linear accretion rate changes not only between the corresponding regions of control and experimental rats but, in the latter, also in different regions of the same bone. Moreover, the higher the bone loss is, the higher bone accretion rate will be.

Functional evidence for this Ca 2+ channel to be involved in the regulation of heart beating, besides L- and T-type channels, was derived from murine embryos where the gene for Ca v1.2 had been ablated. The remaining {"L-type} like" current component was not related to recombinant splice variants of Ca v1.3 containing channels. As recombinant Ca v2.3 channels from rat were reported to be weakly dihydropyridine sensitive, the spontaneous activity of the prenatal hearts from Ca v2.3(-{\textbar}-) mice was compared to that of Ca v2.3(+{\textbar}+) control animals to investigate if Ca v2.3 could represent such a L-type like Ca 2+ channel. The spontaneous activity of murine embryonic hearts was recorded by using a multielectrode array. Between day 9.5 p.c. to 12.5 p.c., the beating frequency of isolated embryonic hearts from Ca v2.3-deficient mice did not differ significantly from control mice but the coefficient of variation within individual episodes was more than four-fold increased in Ca v2.3-deficient mice indicating arrhythmia. In isolated hearts from wild type mice, arrhythmia was induced by superfusion with a solution containing 200 {nM} {SNX-482}, a blocker of some R-type voltage gated Ca 2+ channels, suggesting that R-type channels containing the splice variant Ca v2.3e as ion conducting pore stabilize a more regular heart beat in prenatal mice.

Gestation was also affected by simultaneous lack of {MMP9} and the {uPA} receptor ({uPAR).} Interestingly, {uPA-deficiency} additionally exacerbated the effect of {MMP9-deficiency} on bone growth and an additive effect caused by combined lack in {MMP9} and {uPA} was observed during healing of cutaneous wounds. By comparison, {MMP9-deficiency} combined with absence of either {tPA} or {uPAR} resulted in no significant effect on wound healing, indicating that the role of {uPA} during wound healing is independent of {uPAR}, when {MMP9} is absent. Notably, compensatory upregulation of {uPA} activity was seen in wounds from {MMP9-deficient} mice.

During preference testing, controls receiving long-term access to palatable diet exhibited reduced preference for the diet relative to controls exposed to regular chow only, whereas {ELS} rats demonstrated no such reduction in preference after prolonged palatable diet exposure.

At day 9, 11, and 13, the binding was significantly greater (p \&lt; 0.02) in M compared to C groups. To investigate whether these changes might be related to the alteration in receptor activity, membranes were incubated with {125I-IGF} in the presence of excess insulin with or without unlabeled {IGF-I.} In the absence of insulin, specific {IGF-I} binding in the M group was increased by 41.8 ± 13.8\% (mean ± {SEM} p \&lt; 0.05) relative to C group. Insulin produced a consistent but incomplete inhibition of binding in both C and M, of 75\% and 67\% respectively. In addition, the specific {IGF-I} binding in the presence of insulin was increased in M group by 70.2 ± 9.4\% relative to C, p \&lt; 0.05. To characterize the nature of this binding, cerebral cortical membranes, from both groups, incubated with {125I-IGF-I} were cross-linked, and electrophoresed on 6\% and 10\% {SDS-PAGE} gels under reducing conditions. Autoradiography of the 6\% gel showed two specific bands at 115 {kD} and 240 {kD}, consistent with monomeric and dimeric forms of the {IGF-I} receptor, which were inhibited by excess insulin. In contrast, a 10\% gel showed an additional band at 35 {kD} ({IGF-binding} protein) that was not inhibited by insulin. In both gels, membrane preparations from the M group showed a heightened intensity of the bands relative to C.

In the first study we found a dose-dependent impairment in the acquisition of a modified radial-arm maze task, resulting from injections ({IP)} of {MK801} 10 minutes prior to training. The retention of that learning, as measured by the amount of training required for reacquisition on the following day, was unaffected by the drug. In contrast, in the second study, {MK801} did not block the experience-based facilitation of maternal responding seen 8 days after one hour of exposure to pups: experienced dams showed facilitated onset of maternal behavior, relative to inexperienced dams, regardless of the drug they received. However, injections of {MK-801}, either just before or just after the maternal experience, did lead to some deficits in maternal responding on the first day of testing. We have previously shown that these maternal experience effects are blocked by injections ({ICV}, {SC)} of cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor. These results suggest that the {NMDA} system does not mediate all, if any, of cycloheximide's effects on maternal experience and, furthermore, that the {NMDA} system may mediate some but not all forms of learning. © 1991.},

In this study, pregnant female rats were intragastrically gavaged daily with high doses of alcohol (6 gm/kg body weight) throughout the first 20 days of pregnancy. Blood alcohol levels were measured in the pregnant dams on gestational days 13 (G13) and G20. The ethanol treated group ({EtOH)} was compared to the normal control chowfed ({CF)} group, nutritionally matched pairfed ({PF)} group, and cross-foster ({XF)} group. Cortical barrel development was examined in pups across all treatment groups from G25, corresponding to postnatal day 2 (P2), to G32 corresponding to P9. The {EtOH} and control group pups were weighed, anesthetized, and perfused. Brains were removed and weighed with, and without cerebellum and olfactory bulbs, and neocortex was removed and weighed. Cortices were then flattened, sectioned tangentially, and stained with a metabolic marker, cytochrome oxidase ({CO)} to reveal the barrel field. Progression of barrel development was distinguished into three categories: (a) absent, (b) cloudy barrel-like pattern, and (c) well-formed barrels with intervening septae. The major findings are: (1) {PAE} delayed barrel field development by one or more days, (2) the barrel field first appeared as a cloudy pattern that gave way on subsequent days to an adult-like pattern with clearly demarcated intervening septal regions, (3) the barrel field developed differentially in a lateral-to-medial gradient in both alcohol and control groups, (4) {PAE} delayed birth by one or more days in 53\% of the pups, (5) regardless of whether pups were born on G23 (normal expected birth date for non-alcohol controls) or as in the case for the alcohol-delayed pups born as late as G27, the barrel field was never present at birth suggesting the importance of postnatal experience on barrel field development, and (6) {PAE} did not disrupt the normal barrel field pattern, although both total body and brain weights were compromised. These findings suggest that {PAE} delays the development of the somatosensory cortex ({SI);} such delays may interfere with timing and formation of cortical circuits. It is unknown whether other nuclei along the somatosensory pathway undergo similar delays in development or if {PAE} selectively disrupts cortical circuitry.},

	volume = {165},
	abstract = {Maternal alcohol exposure results in a variety of neurodevelopmental abnormalities that include cognitive and sensorimotor dysfunctions that often persist into adulthood. Many reports of central nervous system disturbances associated within a clinical diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome point toward disturbances in central information processing. In this study, we used the rat barrel field cortex as a model system to examine the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure ({PAE)} on the organization and size of the large whisker representation in layer {IV} of the posteromedial barrel subfield ({PMBSF)} in somatosensory cortex. Pregnant rats (Sprague-Dawley) were intragastrically gavaged daily with alcohol doses (6 gm/kg body weight) from gestational day 1 to day 20 in a chronic binge pattern which produced blood alcohol levels ranging between 260 mg/dl and 324 mg/dl. Chow-fed ({CF)}, pair-fed ({PF)}, and cross-foster ({XF)} groups served as normal, nutritionally matched, and maternal controls, respectively, for the ethanol-exposed ({EtOH)} treatment group. All pups were examined on gestational day 32 corresponding approximately to postnatal day 9. {EtOH} and control group pups were weighed, anesthetized, and perfused. Brains were removed and weighed, with and without cerebellum and olfactory bulbs, and the neocortex was removed and weighed. Cortices were then flattened, sectioned tangentially, and stained with a metabolic marker-cytochrome oxidase-to reveal the barrel field. A subset of 27 cortical barrels, associated with the representation of the large whisker pad, was selected to examine in detail. The major results were: (i) the total barrel field area comprising the {PMBSF} was significantly reduced in {EtOH} (by 17\%) and {XF} (by 16\%) pups compared with {CF} pups, (ii) the sizes of individual barrels within the {PMBSF} were also significantly reduced in {EtOH} (16\%) and {XF} (18\%) pups, (iii) the septal region between barrels was also significantly reduced in {EtOH} (18\%) and {XF} (12\%) pups, (iv) anteriorly located barrels underwent greater reduction in size relative to the posteriorly located barrels, (v) body weights were also significantly reduced in {EtOH} (21\%) and {XF} (27\%) pups, (vi) total brain weight [with and without (forebrain) cerebellum/olfactory bulbs] and cortical weights were also significantly reduced in {EtOH} (total brain weight 15\%, forebrain weight 16\%, cortical weight 15\%) and {XF} (18\%, 19\%, 20\%) pups, and in contrast (vi) neither the overall barrel field pattern nor the pattern of individual barrels in the {PMBSF} was altered. These findings suggest that {PAE} reduces body and brain weight as well as the central cortical representation of the whisker pad, while leaving the overall barrel field pattern unperturbed. While these results might appear to support a miniaturization hypothesis (smaller {PMBSF}, smaller brain, smaller body weight), {PAE} also shows regional vulnerability within the {PMBSF} whereby anteriorly located barrels are most affected.},

	abstract = {Long-term moderate dietary restriction ({DR)} has been reported to extend life spans, delay the onset and decrease the incidence of a broad spectrum of age-associated diseases; however, its effect on cognition is still unclear. Our previous results indicated that long-term {DR} failed to retard cognitive and psychomotor aging in the inbred strain, Fischer-344 rats [18]. In the present experiment, an anti-aging effect of {DR} on various types of cognitive and sensorimotor behaviors was found in F1 hybrid Fischer-344 x Brown Norway (F-{344xBN)} rats, while no effect of {DR} was detected in the second parental inbred strain, Brown-Norway ({BN)} rats. These findings show that the lack of an effect of {DR} on cognitive aging, which was previously found in Fischer-344 rats, is not a universal phenomenon. Instead, the effect of {DR} may depend upon the genetic makeup of the animals. Thus, a more diverse genetic milieu, such as in hybrid rats, relative to inbred rats, may increase the susceptibility to an effect of {DR} on age-related cognitive decline.

Pregnant Wistar rats were treated by oral gavage from gestation day 13 to 21 with vehicle control, 150 mg {DEHP/kg} body weight (bw)/day, 100 mg {DBP/kg} bw/ or a combination of the two compounds ({DEHP} 150 + {DBP} 100 mg/kg bw/day). An additional group of dams received 500 mg {DBP/kg} bw/day. A significant decrease in foetal testicular testosterone levels was observed in animals exposed to 500 mg {DBP/kg/day} or the phthalate mixture. Similarly, histological analysis of the foetal testis revealed that the coadministration of {DEHP} and {DBP} was able to increase the diameter of seminiferous cords and induce gonocyte multinucleation at doses that individually had no significant effects on these variables. However, in the phthalate mixture group, no significant changes were observed in anogenital distance and nipple retention, variables that are used to indicate possible anti-androgenic effects. Also, the adult endpoints investigated, that included reproductive organ weights and the number of spermatids per testis, were unaffected by any treatment regimen. Overall, coadministration of {DEHP} and {DBP} in utero significantly reduced testicular testosterone levels and resulted in misshapen seminiferous cords and gonocyte multinucleation in rat foetal testis. Our results also confirm that these foetal endpoints seem to be the most sensitive markers of prenatal phthalate exposure.},

	volume = {129},
	abstract = {Exercise during pregnancy or lactation may create a competition for glucose between the exercising muscle and either the developing fetus or the lactating mammary gland. To test these two hypotheses, pregnant rats were randomly assigned to isoenergetic diets with varying levels of glucose (20, 40 or 60\% by weight) and fat (30, 22 or 14\%, respectively, by weight) and were rested (R) or exercised (E) on a motorized treadmill at 20 m/min, 60 min/d (low intensity), 7 d/wk throughout pregnancy and lactation. Main effects and selected interactions of diet and exercise during pregnancy and diet, exercise and litter size during lactation were tested using 3 x 2 and 3 x 2 x 2 factorial designs, respectively. Neither diet nor exercise affected pregnancy outcomes. In contrast, during lactation, milk and mammary gland compositions and pup growth were altered. Exercise produced higher milk protein concentrations (40\% glucose diet) and lower milk lactose concentrations (20\% glucose diet). Exercise also lowered mammary gland fat content and produced higher milk fat concentrations. The 60\% glucose diet resulted in the highest milk fat concentrations, but pups of darns fed the 40\% diet were heavier on lactation d 15 than pups of dams fed the 60\% diet, Taken together, these results support the claim of decreased availability of glucose to the mammary gland for lactose synthesis during chronic low intensity exercise. Additionally, the best lactation performance was not supported by a high carbohydrate (60\% glucose), lower fat (14\%) intake. A more moderate carbohydrate (40\% glucose), higher fat (22\%) intake promoted greater pup weights at weaning, suggesting an overlooked role for macronutrient composition in optimizing lactation performance.},

Behavioral data were collected from each dam and her litter on day 9, day 14, and day 19 of lactation, and maternal blood samples collected. Plasma was analyzed for luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone and prolactin. On day 15 of lactation, percent time nursing, number of pups actively nursing, total number of pups nursing and dam location acted as mediating factors of the effect of diet group on plasma luteinizing hormone concentration. No such relationships were seen for plasma follicle stimulating hormone, and only nest condition score appeared to be a mediator for plasma prolactin concentration. In conclusion, this analysis suggests that food restriction indirectly influences plasma concentration of luteinizing hormone, but not follicle stimulating hormone, by changing maternal and pup behaviors. The relationship among diet, behavior and circulating prolactin was less clear.},

However, little is known about the impact of early life experiences on appetitive responses. The present investigation assessed the effects of brief handling/separation or protracted separation from the dams, on feeding and anxiety responses during development. During the first 3 weeks post-partum, Sprague-Dawley rat pups were exposed daily to either brief (15 min) handling/isolation (H), a more protracted (3 h) period of maternal separation ({MS)}, or were not handled ({NH).} When tested on the elevated plus- maze (at 5-6 weeks) H groups displayed less anxiety than {NH} gender-matched controls. Surprisingly, so did the {MS} females. At weaning (Day 22), the {MS} rats weighed significantly less than both the H and {NH} animals; the difference between the H and {MS} was more robust and persisted throughout the experiment (D 62). The H animals of both genders, and the females of the {MS} group, consumed more of the palatable 'snack' than their {NH} counterparts. The feeding suppressant response to the various satiety peptides (bombesin, cholecystokinin, and amylin) was not affected by the early life experience, with exception of cholecystokinin ({CCK)} effects, which were more pronounced in H and {MS} males. These results suggest that early life events may contribute to anxiety and/or ingestive disorders such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia and obesity.},

Fragile X syndrome ({FXS)} is the most common cause of intellectual disability in males and the most common single gene cause of autism. This X-linked disorder is caused by an expansion of a trinucleotide {CGG} repeat ({\textgreater} 200) on the promotor region of the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene ({FMR1).} As a result, the promotor region often becomes methylated which leads to a deficiency or absence of the {FMR1} protein ({FMRP).} Common characteristics of {FXS} include mild to severe cognitive impairments in males but less severe cognitive impairment in females. Physical features of {FXS} include an elongated face, prominent ears, and post-pubertal macroorchidism. Severe obesity in full mutation males is often associated with the Prader-Willi phenotype ({PWP)} which includes hyperphagia, lack of satiation after meals, and hypogonadism or delayed puberty; however, there is no deletion at 15q11-q13 nor uniparental maternal disomy. Herein, we discuss the molecular mechanisms leading to {FXS} and the Prader-Willi phenotype with an emphasis on mouse {FMR1} knockout studies that have shown the reversal of weight increase through {mGluR} antagonists. Finally, we review the current medications used in treatment of {FXS} including the atypical antipsychotics that can lead to weight gain and the research regarding the use of targeted treatments in {FXS} that will hopefully have a significantly beneficial effect on cognition and behavior without weight gain.},

Postnatally, the offspring were maintained on a choline-sufficient diet and at 120 days of age they began 12-arm radial maze training. The maze data revealed two major effects of early choline availability: (1) Both choline-supplemented and choline-deficient rats performed more accurately than control littermates when trials were spaced. These differences in spatial ability did not appear to be a function of differential response or cue-use strategies. (2) Choline-supplemented rats showed little proactive interference when trials were massed; whereas control rats demonstrated moderate levels and choline-deficient rats exhibited high levels of proactive interference as a function of massed trials. These data suggest that the behavioral consequences of early dietary availability of choline may involve the modification of the discriminative abilities used to attend to stimuli that demarcate the end of one trial and the start of another as well as the capacity for remembering the locations that have been visited during a trial.},

	volume = {267},
	abstract = {Lactation is the most energetically expensive period for female mammals and is associated with some of the highest sustained metabolic rates ({SusMR)} in vertebrates (reported as total energy throughput). Females typically deal with this energy demand by increasing food intake and the structure of the alimentary tract may act as the central constraint to ceilings on {SusMR} at about seven times resting or standard metabolic rate ({SMR).} However, demands of lactation may also be mel by using a form of metabolic compensation such as reducing locomotor activities or entering torpor. In some phocid seals, cetaceans and bears, females fast throughout lactation and thus cannot offset the high energetic costs of lactation through increased food intake. We demonstrate that fasting grey seal females sustain, for several weeks, one of the highest total daily energy expenditures ({DEE;} 7.4 x {SMR)} reported in mammals, while progressively reducing maintenance metabolic expenditures during lactation through means not explained by reduction in lean body mass or behavioural changes. Simultaneously, the energy exported in milk is progressively increased, associated with increased lipoprotein lipase activity in the mammary gland, resulting in greater offspring growth. Our results suggest that females use compensatory mechanisms to help meet the extraordinary energetic costs of lactation. Additionally, although the concepts of {SusMR} and ceilings on total {DEE} may be somewhat different in fasting lactating species, our data on phocid seals demonstrate that metabolic ceilings on milk energy output, in general, are not constrained by the same kind of peripheral limitations as are other energy-consuming tissues. In phocid seals, the high ceilings on {DEE} during lactation, coupled with metabolic compensation, are undoubtedly important factors enabling shortened lactation.},

	volume = {92},
	abstract = {Maternal deprivation during the first 10 days of life induces significant behavioral alterations in rodents which persist through adulthood. Physical exercise reduces the cognitive deficits associated with pharmacologic and pathological conditions. Here we investigated whether forced physical exercise alters memory deficits caused by postnatal maternal deprivation. Male rats were divided into four groups: (1) control, (2) deprived, (3) exercised, and (4) deprived + exercised. In groups 2 and 4, pups were deprived from their mothers for 3 h/day during the first 10 days post-birth. In groups 3 and 4, from postnatal day 45 ({PND-45)} on, animals were submitted to forced treadmill exercise. At adulthood, animals were submitted to four different behavioral tasks: open field, Morris water maze ({MWM)}, object recognition ({OR)} and inhibitory avoidance ({IA).} Maternal deprivation had no effect on open field behavior, but disrupted memory in the three other tasks. Physical exercise alone had no effect, except for a slight enhancement of {MWM} learning. Importantly, physical exercise reversed the deficit of {IA} and reduced the deficit of spatial memory but not that of {OR} seen in deprived animals. It is possible that physical exercise may counteract the influence of maternal deprivation on neurohumoral or hormonal memory modulatory systems related to stress. Indeed, the decreasing order of the effect of exercise on the memory disturbances induced by deprivation roughly follows the descending degree of stress associated with each task ({IA} {\textgreater} {MWM} {\textgreater} {OR).} Maternal deprivation is known to hinder hormonal mechanisms involved in coping with stress.

	abstract = {Male mice pups reared with female siblings only are known to develop into more aggressive adults than males reared with males only. The purpose of this study was to examine whether differences in experience of sibling competition and/or parental behaviour might underlie these differences in adult behaviour. The parental care and development of eight litters containing four male pups ({MM} litters) and eight litters containing one male and three females ({MF} litters) was compared. As expected, {MF} males developed into faster attackers than {MM} males. A variety of measures of sibling competitive and aggressive behaviour, both in the home cage and during tests of competition for food, failed to provide any evidence that experience of success in competitive encounters played a prominent role in the development of individual differences in subsequent aggressiveness. On the other hand, clear differences in parental behaviour and offspring growth were detected as a result of the experimental manipulation. Mothers of {MF} litters provided more maternal care and appeared to wean their offspring later than mothers of {MM} litters. Despite this, {MF} pups grew more slowly than {MM} pups, suggesting that their high levels of sucking behaviour reflected high milk demand, perhaps due to a low milk supply, rather than high milk intake. One interpretation is that mothers of litters with a female-biased sex ratio ({MF} mothers) were in poorer condition than those with a male-biased sex ratio ({MM} mothers), and consequently provided less adequate nutrition for their pups. Undernutrition during early life is known to result in the development of more aggressive individuals, perhaps by increasing competition for nipples and thereby promoting a more active/competitive mode of behaviour in later life.},

	volume = {562},
	abstract = {The present analysis indicates that the literature is currently too limited to draw anything but very tentative conclusions about whether amphetamine during pregnancy is detrimental to the offspring. However, exposure to very high doses of the drug appears to be teratogenic; and studies in which animals were exposed to lower doses of either amphetamine or methamphetamine throughout pregnancy indicate that this class of drugs can have long-term neurochemical and behavioral consequences for rodent offspring. They commonly reported behavioral effects include abnormal responding on aversively motivated tasks, and heightened motor activity which might be associated with slower habituation. Neurochemical studies have focused on various aspects of the monoamine neurotransmitter systems and suggest that prenatal amphetamine exposure can increase the synthesis and turnover of {DA} and {NE} and reduce the number of adrenergic receptors in adult offspring. In addition, concentrations of {NE} appear to be reduced at birth suggesting prenatal depletion and are sometimes found to be altered at later times. Although these studies are provocative, the absence of pair-fed controls and cross-fostering prevent ruling out the possible confounding effects of undernutrition and altered maternal care. In addition to the above limited empirical support, the effects of amphetamines on adult brain provide a logical rationale for anticipating that prenatal exposure to the drug could be detrimental. This rationale is essentially that amphetamine can have long-term effects of monoaminergic systems in the brains of adults, including neural degeneration; and, since the drug can cross the placenta, it should also have long-lasting consequences for the developing fetus. It is proposed that the later stages of gestation might be particularly sensitive to the long-term behavioral effects of amphetamine. Although there are no systematic studies on critical periods for the effects of prenatal amphetamine exposure, several reports indicate that exposure restricted to {GD} 12-15 has little effect. Since amphetamine predominantly affects the neuron terminals and terminals develop later than {GD} 15, it is proposed that amphetamine exposure later in gestation, after the monoaminergic systems are more mature, will have a greater effect. The rationale for the long-term behavior effects of prenatal amphetamine is based on studies indicating that 1) rapidly developing systems are very sensitive to insult from external agents; 2) the monoaminergic systems and pituitary-adrenal organization are developing rapidly during the later gestation and early neonatal periods; 3) amphetamine influences each of these systems in adults and the monoamine systems in fetuses; and, 4) alterations in the systems cause predictable behavior changes. It is thus proposed that prenatal amphetamine exposure during the later stages of gestation will have long-lasting effects on behavior which are mediated via its effects on the monoamines and/or the pituitary-adrenal system.},

	volume = {67},
	abstract = {The effects of adult and perinatal lead treatment on the development of locomotor sensitization produced with repeated morphine administration was investigated. In Experiment 1, adult male rats received a diet containing 250 ppm lead acetate or a control diet for 43 days. Animals then received 10 mg/kg morphine sulfate or water vehicle (ip) and locomotor activity was monitored for 14 consecutive days. While both control and lead-exposed animals demonstrated a locomotor sensitization to morphine, the magnitude of the increased locomotor response was reduced in lead-treated animals. Subsequent analysis of blood-lead in the adult lead-exposed animals indicated residue levels ranging between 20 and 30 mug/dl. In Experiment 2, adult female rats were treated daily with 0, 8, or 16 mg lead via gavage for 30 days before breeding with non-exposed males. Lead exposure in dams continued through gestation and until pups were weaned at postnatal day ({PND)} 21. At {PND} 60, male offspring received morphine or vehicle challenges identical to those described in Experiment 1. Animals perinatally exposed to dams receiving 16 mg lead daily demonstrated an enhanced behavioral response to morphine relative to control animals. Analysis of offspring blood indicated lead levels below detectable limits ({\textless}1 {\textless}mu{\textgreater}g/dl) for all animals. The results suggest exposure to lead at environmentally relevant levels produces long-lasting changes in drug-induced behavior, and the developmental period in which lead exposure occurs is a significant contributor to the manifestation of these effects.

Several aspects of postnatal maturation, including synapse elimination, proceeded normally in the absence of the adult {AChR}, but structural development of the endplate was compromised. Later, inadequate compensation by the γ subunit led to severely reduced {AChR} density in mutant endplates relative to controls. This decreased density led to a profound reorganization of {AChR-associated} components of the postsynaptic membrane and cytoskeleton.

During pregnancy and lactation, both circulating leptin concentrations and food intake are elevated, suggesting an ineffectiveness of leptin to reduce food intake in these mice. Thus, this study tested the ability of intracerebroventricular ({ICV)} leptin administration to alter food intake during pregnancy and lactation. Mice during the first, second, and third trimesters of pregnancy, lactating mice on postpartum Day 7, and age-matched female mice were used. Plasma leptin concentrations averaged 2.9 ± 0.3 ng/ml in control mice, increased steadily as pregnancy progressed (3.4 ± 0.7, 29.8 ± 4.5, and 40.5 ± 0.7 ng/ml during the first, second, and third trimesters, respectively), and remained elevated on Day 7 postpartum (26.4 ± 7.8 ng/ml). Mice were food deprived for 4 h, injected {ICV} with vehicle or leptin (1 μg), and food intake was subsequently measured hourly for 3 hr, and after 24 hr. Vehicle-treated pregnant mice consumed marginally more food than cycling control mice, whereas nursing dams ate two to three times as much food as controls. As expected, {ICV} leptin administration reduced 24-hr food intake of control mice by 2 g, or ∼50\%. {ICV-administered} leptin was as effective in reducing food intake of pregnant and lactating mice as observed in control mice. Thus, the elevated circulating leptin concentrations observed in pregnant and nursing mice did not alter the ability of {ICV-administered} leptin to diminish food intake. High plasma concentrations of leptin-binding proteins observed during pregnancy, and probably during lactation, may limit the amount of endogenous leptin reaching the hypothalamus, and may consequently enable increases in food intake concomitant with elevated plasma leptin during these nutritionally demanding periods.},

Two alternative hypotheses were tested: (i) that overexpression of Mn superoxide dismutase (Mn {SOD)} in the mitochondria of Drosophila melanogaster would slow the accrual of oxidative damage and prolong survival or (ii) that there is an evolved optimum level of superoxide anion radical, such that overexpression of Mn {SOD} would have deleterious or neutral effects. Micro-injection and mobilization of a transgene, which contained a 9-kb genomic sequence encoding Mn {SOD}, produced 15 experimental lines overexpressing Mn {SOD} by 5-116\% relative to the parental gamma omega, strain. Comparisons between these lines and control lines containing inserted vector sequences alone indicated that the mean longevity of the experimental lines was decreased by 4-5\% relative to controls, There were no compensatory changes in the metabolic rate, level of physical activity, or the levels of other antioxidants, namely Cu-Zn {SOD}, catalase, and glutathione. There were no differences between groups in rates of mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide release, protein oxidative damage, or resistance to 100\% oxygen or starvation conditions, The experimental lines had a marginally increased resistance to moderate heat stress. These results are consistent with the existence of an optimum level of Mn {SOD} activity which minimizes oxidative stress. The naturally evolved level of Mn {SOD} activity in Drosophila appears to be near the optimum required under normal conditions, although the optimum may be shifted to a higher level under more stressful conditions.

Exposure to prenatal protein malnutrition increases the risk of a number of neuropsychiatric disorders in adulthood including depression, schizophrenia and attentional deficit disorder. In the present experiment, we have examined the effects of stress on extracellular serotonin (5-{HT)} and dopamine in the medial prefrontal cortex and dorsal hippocampus of rats exposed in utero to protein malnutrition. The medial prefrontal cortex and dorsal hippocampus were chosen as two limbic forebrain regions involved in learning and memory, attention and the stress response. Extracellular 5-{HT} and dopamine were determined in the medial prefrontal cortex and dorsal hippocampus of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats using dual probe in vivo microdialysis. Basal extracellular 5-{HT} did not differ between malnourished and well-nourished controls in either the medial prefrontal cortex or the dorsal hippocampus. Basal extracellular dopamine was significantly decreased in the medial prefrontal cortex of malnourished animals. Restraint stress (20 in) produced a significant rise in extracellular dopamine in the medial prefrontal cortex of well-nourished rats but did not alter release in malnourished rats. in malnourished rats, stress produced an increase in 5-{HT} in the hippocampus, whereas stress produced a decrease in 5-{HT} in the hippocampus of well-nourished rats. These data demonstrate that prenatal protein malnutrition alters dopaminergic neurotransmission in the medial prefrontal cortex as well as alters the dopaminergic and serotonergic response to stress. These changes may provide part of the bases for alterations in malnourished animals' response to stress. (c) 2007 Elsevier {B.V.} All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Manipulation of dietary choline levels during gestation results in enduring neurobehavioral changes in offspring that last into adulthood. Alterations of hippocampal function and memory are among the most striking changes. Depending upon the measures assessed, prenatal choline supplementation tends to promote excitatory synaptic efficacy in hippocampal circuits while prenatal choline deficiency diminishes it. However, the mechanisms underlying these changes remain unclear. Transverse hippocampal slices were prepared from adult offspring of dams fed choline supplemented, choline deficient, or control diets. We assessed paired-pulse inhibition, and excitatory synaptic responsiveness before and after activation of cholinergic receptors with Carbachol. Prenatally choline deficient animals yielded significantly fewer electrophysiological viable hippocampal slices than did animals from either of the other two treatment groups. Among the slices tested, there were no differences in paired pulse inhibition between the treatment groups. However, transient cholinergic activation resulted in a prolonged enhancement of the amplitude of the population {EPSP} ({pEPSP)} response in slices from prenatally choline supplemented animals. These results suggest that {GABA} receptor-mediated inhibition remains intact after prenatal choline manipulations, and that enhancement of the excitatory responsiveness of hippocampal circuits in slices from prenatally choline supplemented rats may be related in part to an increase in cholinergic tone within the {CA1} circuit.

A number of candidate mechanisms include increased sympathetic activity, activation of the renin-angiotensin system, altered vasoconstrictor or dilator responses and the attendant systemic inflammatory state. 4. While adult lifestyle factors undoubtedly contribute to the incidence of obesity and its attendant hypertension, evidence suggests that the programming of obesity may occur following over-nutrition during development. A growing body of evidence links maternal obesity, offspring obesity and hypertension. 5. Finally, epigenetic modification of genes relevant to hypertension may contribute to the development of hypertension following a suboptimal intrauterine environment.

Unequivocal evidence of the presence or absence of parental discrimination against males is lacking, however, and the adaptive interpretation of male-based mortality is confounded by an alternative explanation that it reflects differential energetic requirements between the sexes (due to sexual selection for large size in mature males) independent of parental manipulation. To determine whether maternal discrimination against offspring explains postnatal mortality in a sexually dimorphic rodent, we examined patterns of growth and mortality in offspring of food-restricted and food-enriched lactating bushy-tailed woodrats, Neotoma cinerea. We also monitored mothers and their litters daily throughout lactation for evidence of maternal discrimination against offspring. Offspring of food-restricted mothers showed depressed growth, and mortality of offspring born to food-restricted and food-enriched mothers was male-biased, but in the absence of maternal discrimination. Offspring that died were no less likely to be attached to their mother's teats in the 10 days prior to death than were offspring that successfully weaned. Similarly, offspring of food-restricted mothers were attached as often as were offspring of food-enriched mothers. In a series of behavioural arena trials in the first 10 days after birth, restricted mothers were no less attentive toward their sons than they were to their daughters, nor did mothers treat their offspring that did not survive to weaning differently from those that survived. Our findings provide empirical evidence that postnatal, sex-biased mortality in offspring is not necessarily due to parental intervention, and they call into question the adaptive interpretations of previous examples of sex-biased offspring mortality.},

In contrast, the same treatment of {MSG} rats had only a small effect on late appearance of obesity, i.e. in early postnatally overfed and normally fed {MSG} rats a similar pattern of body weight. food intake, adiposity and {AP} activity was found after weaning. The effect of {MSG-treatment} was also accompanied by the appearance of normophagia, hypophagia and stunted growth on day 40 and day 80, respectively. Moreover, the size of fat depots and the increase of brush-border-bound {AP} activity in {MSG} rats belonging to the {SL} and {NL} groups was quantitatively similar to the values size of these parameters observed in {SL} obese rats subjected to early postnatal overnutrition. These results indicate that postnatal nutritional experience (overnutrition) may represent a predisposing factor in control rats from small litters for the development of obesity in later life. Permanently increased small intestinal {AP} activity observed after weaning in both models of obesity when hyperphagia is not present suggest that these functional changes and associated alterations in food digestion could be a component of regulatory mechanisms contributing to the maintenance of their elevated body fat weight.},

	abstract = {Interleukin 1 ({IL-1)} administration produces anorexia. Among unanswered questions about this effect are 1) whether it plays a role in the cachexia associated with chronic infection and cancer, and 2) whether {IL-1} acts directly on food intake or indirectly by first lowering the set point for body weight. To investigate these questions, rats were infused with recombinant {IL-1} continuously for 14 days through osmotic minipumps. Tolerance to the anorexic effects of the infusion developed within a few days. Control experiments showed that neither loss of {IL-1} potency nor failure in the delivery system were responsible for recovery of food intake. Prior weight reduction completely overrode the anorexic effects of {IL-1;} previously food-restricted rats were hyperphagic initially despite receiving {IL-1.} This result is consistent with the view that {IL-1} lowers the set point for body weight, but the development of tolerance prevented the full evaluation of this interpretation.},

	abstract = {A world-wide series of epidemiological and experimental studies have demonstrated that there is an association between being small at birth, accelerated growth in early postnatal life and the emergence of insulin resistance in adult life. The aim of this study was to investigate why accelerated growth occurs in postnatal life after in utero growth restriction. Samples of quadriceps muscle were collected at similar to 140 days gestation (term similar to 150 days gestation) from normally grown fetal lambs (Control, n = 7) and from growth restricted fetal lambs (placentally restricted: {PR}, n = 8) and from Control (n = 14) and {PR} (n = 9) lambs at 21 days after birth. The abundance of the insulin and {IGF1} receptor protein was higher in the quadriceps muscle of the {PR} fetus, but there was a lower abundance of the insulin signalling molecule {PKC} zeta, and {GLUT4} protein in the {PR} group. At 21 days of postnatal age, insulin receptor abundance remained higher in the muscle of the {PR} lamb, and there was also an up-regulation of the insulin signalling molecules, {PI3Kinase} p85, Akt1 and Akt2 and of the {GLUT4} protein in the {PR} group. Fetal growth restriction therefore results in an increased abundance of the insulin receptor in skeletal muscle, which persists after birth when it is associated with an upregulation of insulin signalling molecules and the glucose transporter, {GLUT4.} These data provide evidence that the origins of the accelerated growth experienced by the small baby after birth lie in the adaptive response of the growth restricted fetus to its low placental substrate supply.},

In the present study, we show that maternal loss of Ube3a (Ube3e(m-{/P+))} in the mouse model leads to motor deficits that could be attributed to the dysfunction of the nigrostriatal pathway. The number of tyrosine hydroxylase positive neurons in the substantia nigra was significantly reduced in Ube3e(m-{/P+)} mice as compared to the wild type counterparts. The Ube3e(m-{/P+)} mice performed poorly in behavioural paradigms sensitive to nigrostriatal dysfunction. Even though the tyrosine hydroxylase staining was apparently the same in the striatum of both genotypes, the presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins were significantly reduced in Ube3e(m-{/P+)} mice. These findings suggest that the abnormality in the nigrostriatal pathway along with the cerebellum produces the observed motor dysfunctions in Ube3e(m-{/P+)} mice. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

	volume = {16},
	abstract = {Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a low-energy diet on rat dams and physical activity in water during the perinatal period on body weight, somatic growth, and neuromotor development. Methods: Rat dams were fed with control or low-energy diets from the third gestational week. At 8 days old the littermates were either involved or not in aquatic physical activity. The groups were initially divided into normocaloric (C) or low-energy ({LE)} diets. The study included 52 male pups from primiparous Wistar rats. Exercise in water was carried out with the pups from the age of 8 to 52 days. Four experimental groups were formed: inactive control ({IC)}, active control ({AC)}, inactive low-energy ({ILE)}, and active low-energy ({ALE).} Somatic growth (tail length ({TL)}, lateral-lateral axis of the skull ({LLAS)}, anterior-posterior axis of the skull ({APAS)}, and longitudinal axis ({LA))}, maturation of reflexes and neuromotor development of pup locomotion were analyzed along with a biochemical profile. Results: During lactation the body weight range (\%) was lower for {ILE} compared with {IC} (38\%, P {\textless} 0.05), as {ALE} body weight gain was lower (29\%, P {\textless} 0.05) compared with {AC} and bigger (17\%, P {\textless} 0.05) compared with {ILE.} At 21st day reduced body weight was observed in {LE} diet groups ({IC} = 48.62+/-1.36 g; {AC} = 48.30+/-1.03 g; {ILE} = 30.49+/-1.60 g; {ALE} = 39.38+/-1.06 g, P {\textless} 0.05). Compared with control diet, the {LE} diet delayed somatic growth of pups from 2nd week to end lactation, but the early physical activity in {LE} group improved some parameters of somatic growth ({TL:} {IC} = 68.87+/-1.00 mm, {AC} = 68.80+/-1.10 mm, {ILE} = 60.21+/-1.14 mm, {ALE} = 64.61+/-0.55 mm; {LA:} {IC} = 113.21+/-1.73 mm, {AC} = 113.33+/-1.37 mm, {ILE} = 99.40+/-1.67 mm, {ALE} = 106.76+/-0.79 mm; {APAS:} {IC} = 37.10+/-0.32 mm, {AC:} 37.18+/-0.23 mm, {ILE} = 34.11+/-0.33 mm, {ALE} = 35.84+/-0.30 mm; {LLAS:} {IC} = 18.71+/-0.24 mm, {AC} = 19.00+/-0.16 mm, {ILE} = 17.10+/-0.19 mm, {ALE} = 17.87+/-0.11 mm, P {\textless} 0.05) and reflex ontogeny. Nevertheless, fewer changes were observed in locomotor activity (P {\textgreater} 0.05). At 60 days old, the food intake and measures of murinometrics did not differ among groups, but they had lower glucose levels {ILE} ({IC} = 4.14+/-0.23 mmol/l, {AC} = 3.70+/-0.22 mmol/l, {ILE} = 3.38+/-0.20 mmol/l, {ALE} = 4.17+/-0.09 mmol/l, P {\textless} 0.05). Conclusion: Taken together, we suggest that physical activity in water acts as a beneficial factor in {LE} diets of dams during the perinatal period. Further study is necessary to investigate the role of physical activity for adaptation against adverse nutritional stimuli.},

Because the cholinergic system is associated with cognitive and motor functions, cholinergic deficits in {RTT} may underlie some of the behavioral abnormalities. In rodents, increased choline availability during development enhances transmission at cholinergic synapses and improves behavioral performance throughout life. We examined whether choline supplementation of nursing dams would attenuate deficits in Mecp21lox offspring, a mouse model of {RTT.} Dams were given choline in drinking water, and pups nursed from birth to weaning. Offspring were assessed on development and behavior. In Mecp21lox males, choline supplementation improved motor coordination and locomotor activity, whereas in females it enhanced grip strength. Choline supplementation did not improve response to fear conditioning. Postnatal choline supplementation attenuates some behavioral deficits in Mecp21lox mice and should be explored further as a therapeutic agent in {RTT.} © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

At weaning, Mecp21lox and control mice were assigned to enriched or standard housing. From postnatal day 29 to 43, mice were subjected to behavioural tasks measuring motor and cognitive performance. At postnatal day 44, volumes of whole brain, cerebellum, ventricles, and motor cortex were measured using magnetic resonance imaging. {EE} provided subtle improvements to locomotor activity and contextual fear conditioning in Mecp21lox mice. Additionally, {EE} reduced ventricular volumes, which correlated with improved locomotor activity, suggesting that neuroanatomical changes contribute to improved behaviour.

In vivo, {TAFI} deficiency did not influence occlusion time in either an arterial or a venous thrombosis model. The effects of {TAFI} deficiency were also investigated in thrombin-induced pulmonary thromboembolism, Factor X coagulant protein-induced thrombosis and endotoxin-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation models. In these models, {TAFI} deficiency did not improve the morbidity or mortality. Based on the kaolin-induced writhing test, {TAFI} did not play a major role in bradykinin degradation under normal conditions.

Following birth, mouse pups in all experiments were reared in either ”normally nourished” or ”undernourished” conditions by maintaining litter sizes at 6 or 16, respectively. Experiments 1 and 2 examined the development of adult like patterns of swimming behaviors and spontaneous locomotor activity, respectively, as a function of litter size. The maturation of both behavior patterns was delayed by about 2 days in the 16 litter mice. In experiment 3, normally nourished and undernourished mice received 25 trials in a shock escape T maze at 9, 11, and 13 days of age, followed by similar retention tests 24 hr later. Although litter size had little effect upon correct turns at each age during training, mice reared in litters of six exhibited significant retention of prior training by 12 days of age, whereas comparable retention was not noted for the large litter mice until 14 days of age. Overall, these results suggest that nutritional deficits, imposed by rearing in large litters during the postnatal period of rapid central nervous system maturation, retard the development of behavioral capacities involving both unlearned and learned responses.},

	abstract = {Pregnant dams were fed a 20\% protein diet with caffeine (2 mg/100 g b.wt.), starting on day 9 of gestation. At birth, each dam with 8 assigned pups was fed this diet until weaning, day 22. On day 22, female rats were caged and fed this diet until day 93. Starting on day 93, the caffeine-supplemented diet was replaced with a caffeine-free, 20\% protein diet until day 388.

On day 388, the animals were killed, and their brains were removed and divided into 7 regions. The weight, {DNA}, protein and zinc contents, and alkaline phosphatase activity of each region were determined. Locomotive activity of the caffeine-fed group was higher than in the noncaffeine control group. Accumulative activity scores showed 3 subgroups (high, medium, and low) in both groups at day 93. The medium activity subgroup in the caffeine group was greater than the controls from day 72 to day 93.

Chronic caffeine intake in early life permanently affected the medium activity subgroup. Furthermore, various regions of the brain were biochemically altered in spite of the feeding of a noncaffeine diet for almost 300 days after caffeine.},

The drug was given at two dosage levels of 0.3\% and 0.5\% respectively mixed with rat diet throughout gestation and suckling. The thyroid glands of treated fetuses and pups and of untreated control animals of the same age groups were monitored by histologic examination. At the behavioral level, the frequency of individual movements of head, forelimbs and mouth was significantly reduced in treated fetuses. The combination movements of head, mouth and forelimbs showed severe deficits both quantitatively and qualitatively for all ages in the experimental group from day 18 of gestation. Hypothyroid pups of dams raised on 0.5\% {PTU} were unable to attach to the nipple of the mother and died within a few days. Pups of dams raised on 0.3\% {PTU} showed longer latencies for nipple attachment, and their gross motor movements of rooting and suckling were greatly impaired. These results have been discussed in relation to the development of suckling behavior to indicate that, during ontogeny, some decisive step in the integration of individual movements takes place in utero from day 18 of gestation. This coincides with the establishment of pituitary thryoid relationship, which is continued through postnatal stages.},

	abstract = {I studied reproductive costs in the female Columbian ground squirrel (Spermophilus columbianus) using individually marked animals. I compared weight changes during the active season and over winter, and mortality for females that did and did not wean young. Females raising young were heavier at emergence in that spring than unsuccessful ones. Females that did not raise young gained more weight during summer, were heavier than successful females at the time of entry into hibernation, and were heavier emerging from hibernation the following spring. Over-winter mortality was higher for females that reared young compared to reproductively unsuccessful females. A food supplementation experiment showed that energy-rich food can accelerate individuals' weight gain. Interactions between litter size, birth weight, weight at emergence from the natal burrow, survival of young to yearling age, and maternal fitness were also studied. Litter sizes were experimentally manipulated to evaluate how females cope with costs of rearing one additional young. Birth weight of juveniles was positively correlated with survival to emergence from the natal burrow and with survival to yearling age, Partial litter loss was higher in experimentally enlarged litters than in either experimentally decreased or control litters. Total litter loss, survival of adult females or the probability of weaning young the following year were not affected by the litter size manipulation. Females appear to adjust the size of their litter before birth, and to some extent during lactation, to their ability to wean young.},

Chronic exposure to progesterone during pregnancy and its withdrawal following delivery increases depression and anxiety. In addition, there are complex interactions between hormones, neurotransmitters, and trace elements. Zinc (Zn) and magnesium (Mg) influence the nervous system by impacting synaptic neurotransmission in the brain. Thiamine (Vit B-1) deficiency results in a high percentage of depressive behaviors. Elevated levels of reactive oxygen species in pregnancy are implicated in the pathogenesis of major depression. Methods: We examined the effects of different combinations of Zn, Mg, and Vit B-1 in an animal model of {PPD.} {ZnCl}, {MgCl}, and thiamine-{HCl} were administered to {PPD-induced} mice. Depression, anxiety-related behavior, and total antioxidant capacity ({TAC)} were assessed. Depression and anxiety-like behavior were evaluated by the forced swimming test ({FST)} and elevated plus-maze, respectively. Results: The acute combined administration of Zn, Mg, and Vit B-1 significantly decreased immobility time in {FST}, increased the percentage of both time spent in- and entries to open arms in the elevated plus-maze, and augmented {TAC.} Conclusion: Our data suggest that acute administration of combined treatment with Zn, Mg, and Vit B-1 on postpartum day 3 improves depressive symptoms and anxiety-like behaviors.

Hearing disturbances and an elevated relative thyroid weight were observed in offspring of both sexes in the 0.4 mg/kg/day group. The Biel-type water T-maze test showed an increase in the number of errors made by females in the 0.4 mg/kg/day group. Histopathologically, flattening of follicular epithelium, a decrease in resorptive colloid droplets, degeneration of follicular epithelium, and hyperplasia of follicular epithelium were observed in males belonging to the 0.4 mg/kg/day group. Histopathological abnormalities were also observed in some offspring belonging to the 0.08 mg/kg/day group. In the dams, hypertrophy of the follicular epithelium of the thyroid was observed in the 0.4 mg/kg/day group. Although we could not explain the mechanism for the difference in the effects seen in the offspring and the dams, the effect of {PTU} in utero through lactational exposure is apparently different from that resulting from exposure in homeostatically mature rats. Most reports studying {PTU} have involved administration in water or in food, and reports on the oral gavage of {PTU} during the fetal organogenesis and lactation period are very rare. This assumes that dosages {\textgreater} 0.4 mg/kg/day would also produce clear anti-thyroid effects by oral gavage and, possibly, emphasizes that dosages {\textless} 0.4 mg/kg/day did not have a noticeable effect. Based on the present results, a study to determine the reproducibility of the data in a much larger number of dams will be performed to confirm the findings in the present study, and to evaluate other endpoints, such as hormonal evaluation of dams and their offspring, sexual developmental landmarks, and fertility of the offspring.},

We were unable to demonstrate a difference in the number, amplitude, length, or area of corticosterone secretory pulses between control and {IUGR} animals; although again, there was a significant decrease with age. The mean peak plasma concentration of corticosterone in response to a noise stress also declined with age but was unaffected by {IUGR.} There were no consistent, statistically significant differences in behavioral responses between normal control and {IUGR} animals or between groups of animals at different ages.

	abstract = {The brain is constantly exposed to external and internal input and to function in an ever-changing environment we are dependent on processes that enable the brain to adapt to new stimuli. Exposure to postnatal environmental stimuli can interfere with vital adaption processes and cause long-term changes in physiological function and behavior. Early-life alterations in brain function may result in impaired ability to adapt to new situations, in altered sensitivity to challenges later in life and thereby mediate risk or protection for psychopathology such as alcohol use disorders ({AUD).} In clinical research the studies of mechanisms, mediators, and causal relation between early environmental factors and vulnerability to {AUD} are restricted and attempts are made to find valid animal models for studies of the early-life influence on the brain. This review focuses on rodent models and the effects of adverse and naturalistic conditions on peptide networks within the brain and pituitary gland. Importantly, the consequences of alcohol addiction are not discussed but rather neurobiological alterations that can cause risk consumption and vulnerability to addiction. The article reviews earlier results and includes new data and multivariate data analysis with emphasis on endogenous opioid peptides but also oxytocin and vasopressin. These peptides are vital for developmental processes and it is hypothesized that early-life changes in peptide networks may interfere with neuronal processes and thereby contribute the individual vulnerability for {AUD.} The summarized results indicate a link between early-life rearing conditions, opioids, and ethanol consumption and that the ethanol-induced effects and the treatment with opioid antagonists later in life are dependent on early-life experiences. Endogenous opioids are therefore of interest to further study in the early-life impact on individual differences in vulnerability to {AUD} and treatment outcome. © 2012 Nylander and Roman.},

Specifically, we assessed the quantitative relationships between lactose load and the series capacities of lactase and the Na+-glucose cotransporter ({SGLT-1).} Both capacities increased significantly with age in suckling pups as a result of increasing intestinal mass and maintenance of mass-specific activities. The youngest pups examined (5 days) had surprisingly high safety factors of 8-13 for both lactase and {SGLT-1}, possibly because milk contains lactase substrates other than lactose; it also, however, suggests that their intestinal capacities were being prepared to meet future demands rather than just current ones. By day 10 (and also at day 15), increased lactose loads resulted in lower safety factors of 4-6, values more typical of adult intestines. The safety factor of {SGLT-1} in day 30 (weanling) and day 100 (adult) rats was only similar to 1.0. This was initially unexpected, because most adult intestines maintain a modest reserve capacity beyond nutrient load values, but postweaning rats appear to use hindgut fermentation, assessed by gut morphology and hydrogen production assays, as a built-in reserve capacity. The series capacities of lactase and {SGLT-1} varied in concert with each other over ontogeny and as lactose load was manipulated by experimental variation in litter size.},

The altered in utero hormonal/ metabolic milieu was associated with no change in basal total {IRS-1}, p85, and p110 beta subunits of {PI} 3- kinase, {PKC} theta, and {PKC} zeta concentrations but an increase in basal {IRS-2} ( P {\textless} 0.05) only in the {CM/SP} group and an increase in basal phospho ( p)- {PDK-1} ( P {\textless} 0.05), p-Akt ( P {\textless} 0.05), and p- {PKC} zeta ( P {\textless} 0.05) concentrations in the {CM/SP} and {SM/SP} groups. Insulin-stimulated increases in p-{PDK-1} ( P {\textless} 0.05) and p-Akt ( P {\textless} 0.0007), with no increase in p- {PKC} zeta, were seen in both {CM/SP} and {SM/SP} groups. {SHP2} ( P {\textless} 0.03) and {PTP1B} ( P {\textless} 0.03) increased only in {SM/SP} with no change in {PTEN} in {CM/SP} and {SM/} {SP} groups. Aberrations in kinase and phosphatase moieties in the adult {IUGR} offspring were initiated in utero but further sculpted by the early postnatal nutritional state. Although the {CM/} {SP} group demonstrated enhanced kinase activation, the {SM/} {SP} group revealed an added increase in phosphatase concentrations with the net result of heightened basal insulin sensitivity in both groups. The inability to further respond to exogenous insulin was due to the key molecular distal roadblock consisting of resistance to phosphorylate and activate {PKC} zeta necessary for {GLUT4} translocation. This protective adaptation may become maladaptive and serve as a forerunner for gestational and type 2 diabetes mellitus.},

The role of exoproteins in the pathogenesis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa keratitis was investigated in three animal models by assessing the relationship between corneal virulence and the activities of exotoxin A, elastase, alkaline protease, and an uncharacterized protease, protease {IV.} Methods. The four Pseudomonas strains tested included a prototype strain ({ATCC} 27853) producing exotoxin A, elastase, and alkaline protease; a parent strain ({PA103)} producing only exotoxin A and protease {IV;} a mutant ({PA103-29)} producing only protease {IV;} and a mutant ({PA103-AP1)} producing exotoxin A and having only approximately 5\% of the protease {IV} activity of its parent Corneal virulence was evaluated in the mouse scratch, rabbit scratch, and rabbit intrastromal models in terms of clinical signs (slit lamp examination, slit lamp examination), and viable bacteria. Results. Protease {IV}, the only protease produced by {PA103} and {PA103-29}, was found to produce a unique band on zymograms (120 {kDa)} and to react distinctively with a synthetic substrate. Evidence for the role of protease {IV} in corneal virulence included two findings: {PA103-29}, which produced protease {TV} but not the other exoproteins, caused infections that were as severe as those caused by the prototype strain ({ATCC} 27853) in an three models (P {\textgreater} 0.24); and {PA103-AP1}, the strain deficient in 95\% of the parent protease {IV} activity, mediated infections characterized by slit lamp examination scores significantly lower than those of infections caused by the parent ({PA103)} or the prototype strain ({ATCC} 27853) in the rabbit and mouse scratch models (P {\textless} 0.02). Conclusions. Protease {IV} was found to be a novel Pseudomonas protease contributing to corneal virulence in rabbits and mice when infections were initiated at the corneal surface. Furthermore, production of protease {IV} in low quantities was sufficient for virulence when the topical stages of keratitis were bypassed by an intrastromal injection of Pseudomonas.},

However, very little is known about the consequences of combining models of synaptic dysfunction with controlled environmental manipulations. Therefore, to generate new insights into gene-environment interactions and complex behaviour, we examined the influence of variable prenatal stress ({PNS)} on two mouse lines with mutations in synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 {kDa} (Snap-25): the blind-drunk (Bdr) point mutant and heterozygous Snap-25 knockout mice. Neonatal development was analysed in addition to an assessment of adult behavioural phenotypes relevant to the psychotic, cognitive and negative aspects of schizophrenia. These data show that {PNS} influenced specific anxiety-related behaviour in all animals. In addition, sensorimotor gating deficits previously noted in Bdr mutants were markedly enhanced by {PNS;} significantly, these effects could be reversed with the application of anti-psychotic drugs. Moreover, social interaction abnormalities were observed only in Bdr animals from stressed dams but not in wild-type littermates or mutants from non-stressed mothers. These results show for the first time that combining a synaptic mouse point mutant with a controlled prenatal stressor paradigm produces both modified and previously unseen phenotypes, generating new insights into the interactions between genetics and the environment relevant to the study of psychiatric disease.},

Infusion of α-fluoromethylhistidine ({FMH)}, a 'suicide' inhibitor of histidine decarboxylase ({HDC)}, into the third cerebroventricle induced feeding in the early light phase when the histamine synthesis was most accelerated. {FMH} at an optimum 2.24 μmol dose elicited feeding in 100\% of rats. Treatment of {FMH} specifically and selectively decreased concentration of histamine without affecting concentrations of catecholamines in the hypothalamus. Immediately before the dark phase, when the histamine synthesis was normally lower, {FMH} infusion did not affect feeding-related parameters such as meal size, meal duration or latency to eat. Conversely, thioperamide, which facilitates both synthesis and release of neuronal histamine by blocking presynaptic autoinhibitory H3 receptors, significantly decreased food intake after infusion of a 100-nmol dose into the third cerebroventricle. The effect of thioperamide was abolished with i.p. injection of 26 μmol/kg chlorpheniramine, an H1 antagonist. {FMH} at 224 nmol was microinfused bilaterally into the feeding-related nuclei in the hypothalamus. The ventromedial nucleus ({VMH)} and the paraventricular nculeus ({PVN)}, but not the lateral hypothalamus, the dorsomedial hypothalamus or the preoptic anterior hypothalamus were identified as the active sites for the modulation.

Nevertheless, they still have a preference for sucrose, they can learn the location of food rewards, and they can form a conditioned-place preference for drugs. Dopamine signaling can be restored to the striatum by several different viral gene-therapy procedures. Restoring dopamine signaling selectively to the dorsal striatum is sufficient to allow feeding, locomotion, and reward-based learning. The rescued mice appear to have normal motivation to engage in all goal-directed behaviors that have been tested. The results suggest that dopamine facilitates the output from dorsal striatum, which provides a permissive signal allowing feeding and other goal-directed behaviors.},

	abstract = {Mdm2 and Mdm4 are homologous {RING} domain-containing proteins that negatively regulate the tumor suppressor p53 under physiological and stress conditions. The {RING} domain of Mdm2 encodes an E3-ubiquitin ligase that promotes p53 degradation. In addition, Mdm2 and Mdm4 interact through their respective {RING} domains. The in vivo significance of Mdm2-Mdm4 heterodimerization in regulation of p53 function is unknown. In this study, we generated an Mdm4 conditional allele lacking the {RING} domain to investigate its role in Mdm2 and p53 regulation. Our results demonstrate that homozygous deletion of the Mdm4 {RING} domain results in prenatal lethality. Mechanistically, Mdm2-Mdm4 heterodimerization is critical for inhibiting lethal p53 activation during early embryogenesis. However, Mdm2-Mdm4 interaction is dispensable for regulating p53 activity as well as the stability of Mdm2 and p53 at later stages of development. We propose that Mdm4 is a key cofactor of Mdm2 that inhibits p53 activity primarily during early embryogenesis but is dispensable for regulating p53 and Mdm2 stability in the adult mouse.},

	volume = {9},
	abstract = {The inner-membrane protein {BacA} affects Brucella {LPS} structure. A {bacA} deletion mutant of Brucella abortus, known as {KL7} ({bacA(mut)-KL7)}, is attenuated in {BALB/c} mice and protects against challenge. Thus, {bacA} mutation was a candidate for incorporation into live attenuated vaccines. We assessed {bacA(mut)-KL7} in 2 additional mouse strains: the more resistant {C57BL/6} that produces interferon-gamma throughout the infection and the highly susceptible interferon-gamma-deficient {C57BL/6} in which brucellae exhibit continual exponential growth. While it was hypothesized that {bacA(mut)-KL7} would exhibit even greater attenuation relative to its parent strain B. abortus 2308 in {C57BL/6} mice than it did in {BALB/c} mice, this was not the case. Moreover, it was more pathogenic in {C57BL/6} interferon-gamma-deficient mice than 2308 causing abscesses and wasting even though the splenic loads of {bacA(mut)-KL7} were significantly lower. These 2 observations were correlated, respectively, with an ability of {IFN} gamma-activated macrophages to equivalently control strains 2308 and {bacA(mut)-KL7} and the ability of {bacA(mut)-KL7} organism and its {LPS} to induce greater amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines than 2308. We conclude that attenuation properties of {bacA} mutation are dependent upon the nature of the host but more importantly that bacterial gene deletion can result in increased host pathology without an increase in bacterial load, crucial considerations for vaccine design.

	volume = {14},
	abstract = {Undernutrition of rodents has been claimed to result in long-term behavioural deficits in motor coordination and spatial learning ability, although the literature on this is somewhat conflicting. We have recently been engaged in a study of the effects of either pre- or post-weaning undernutrition on longevity in mice. As part of this ageing study, we have also assessed the effects of such nutritional regimes on motor coordination and spatial learning ability of mice. Motor coordination was tested in 21-week-old control and previously undernourished mice by assessing their ability to remain on a revolving drum. We have found that mice previously undernourished either during the pre- or post-weaning period performed better than controls during some, but not all, of the test days. Spatial learning was tested in 50-58-week-old mice using the Morris water maze. In this instance we found that mice previously undernourished during the pre- weaning period performed better at this task than either controls or mice undernourished for a period after weaning. It seems that undernutrition during the pre- weaning period may, paradoxically, improve the performance of mice in these behavioural tasks compared to controls. Undernutrition after weaning had little or no effect on these behavioural measures. The exact mechanisms involved in causing the observed long-term changes in functional capacity due to a period of undernutrition from conception until weaning age of the mice in our study remain unknown.},

The aim of the present study is to determine if prenatal stress at a given day of gestation alters social behavior in adult offspring.

When adult, their offsprings were studied in anxiety, neophobic and social behaviors. The results showed that S10 and S19 rats were more anxious and less aggressive than control rats, while the anxious and aggressive behavior of S14 rats was similar to that of the control ones. It is suggested that day 14 of pregnancy is a hyposensitive period to stressful agents due to an important plasticity of the developing gross nervous structures.

We tested the hypothesis that intrauterine fetal growth restriction caused by placental insufficiency results in low-birth-weight offspring with impaired endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation, enhanced vasoconstriction, and hypertension. The body weight and arterial pressure were measured in young (4 weeks), adolescent (8 weeks), and adult (12 weeks) male offspring of normal pregnant rats and pregnant rats with reduced uteroplacental perfusion (intrauterine growth-restricted, {IUGR)}, and aortic strips were isolated for measurement of isometric contraction. The body weight was lower whereas the arterial pressure was higher in {IUGR} than normal rats at 4 weeks (113±3 versus 98±2), 8 weeks (133±3 versus 121±6), and 12 weeks (144±4 versus 131±3 mm Hg). Phe (10 -5 {mol/L)} caused an increase in active stress that was greater in {IUGR} than in normal rats at 4 weeks (12.4 versus 7.8), 8 weeks (13.3 versus 8.4), and 12 weeks (14.6 versus 9.0×10 4 N/m 2). Removal of the endothelium enhanced Phe-induced stress in normal but not {IUGR} rats. In endothelium-intact strips, acetylcholine ({ACh)} caused relaxation of Phe contraction and induced nitrite/nitrate production that were smaller in {IUGR} than normal rats. L-{NAME} (10 -4 {mol/L)}, which inhibits {NO} synthase, or {ODQ} (10 -5 {mol/L)}, which inhibits {cGMP} production in smooth muscle, inhibited {ACh-induced} relaxation and enhanced Phe contraction in normal but not {IUGR} rats. Thus endothelium-dependent {NO-mediated} vascular relaxation is inhibited in {IUGR} offspring of pregnant rats with reduced uteroplacental perfusion, and this may explain the increased vascular constriction and arterial pressure in young adults with low birth weight.},

Thus, altered mother-litter bonds and deficient environmental interactions may interfere with the brain pluripotential capabilities of the newborn. To gather information concerning the mechanisms underlying perinatal undernutrition we designed a paradigm of undernutrition and neonatal rehabilitation in the rat. An underfed group came from pregnant Wistar rats fed with 50\% of the diet from G6 to G12 and with 60\% from G13 until G21. After birth, pups were daily undernourished during 12 h daily by rotating a pair of lactating well-nourished dams which had one of their nipples subcutaneously ligated. The rehabilitated animals were undernourished pups neonatally fed by a pair of normally lactating dams. Controls received plenty of food during the pre- and neonatal periods. Pups were sacrificed at 12, 20 and 30 days of age. Perinatal underfeeding significantly reduced body and brain weights and neuronal morphometric parameters. Normal neonatal feeding in the newborn ameliorated the damages associated to food deprivation. The current undernourishing paradigm may be helpful to assess brain development alterations, as well as to study the compensatory mechanisms associated to salutary epigenetic influences.},

	volume = {81},
	abstract = {The roles of androgen and oestrogen in the perinatal and postpubertal stages of development on the masculinization of female patterns of growth have been investigated in several experiments in rats. A stimulatory effect of testosterone on subsequent growth and efficiency of food utilization was only observed when administered perinatally to intact females as the propionate ester. Thus females which were untreated (or androgenized) perinatally and ovariectomized at weaning failed to grow more rapidly or utilize food more efficiently when treated with mixed testosterone esters from 36 to 38 days of age. Also autoimmunity to luteinizing hormone releasing hormone ({LH-RH)} had little effect on the growth or efficiency of food utilization of male rats, although testicular development was grossly affected. An inhibitory effect of oestrogen on subsequent growth and efficiency of food utilization was demonstrated by surgical ovariectomy and by autoimmunity to {LH-RH.} Also perinatal administration of oestradiol benzoate to intact female rats depressed growth below that of untreated intact litter-mate females until about 50 days of age. Then oestradiol benzoate-treated female rats grew to a larger size than untreated intact litter-mates but not to a heavier weight than untreated litter-mate females which like the oestradiol benzoate-treated females, were ovariectomized at 18-21 days of age. Both of these groups of female rats differed markedly in weight gain from females which were perinatally androgenized and ovariectomized at weaning. The effects of androgenization and ovariectomy on weight gain were comparable and additive in female rats fed restrictedly or ad libitum. Nevertheless, androgenized+ovariectomized female rats fed restrictedly or ad libitum failed to grow as rapidly as male rats. Some additional factor(s) prevents complete masculinization of the female pattern of development. The stimulatory effects of androgenization and ovariectomy on the growth of females appear to be related to endocrine mechanisms controlling the onset of pubertal changes in somatic development.},

On {PND} 70 the subjects were tested for handedness using a paw preference task assessing both the animals' capability to reach a food pellet in a feeding tube and the individual preference for the use of one of the other forepaw. O3 exposure did not affect the animals' capability to learn the task but caused changes in handedness. Specifically, females exposed to the intermediate O3 concentration showed a reduced preference for the right paw than both their same-sex controls and 0.6 ppm males. On {PND} 100, mice underwent a hot plate test after {IP} treatment by either saline or morphine {HCl} (10 mg/kg). The results were generally in the direction of reduced drug sensitivity after exposure to the highest concentration. The evidence for this effect was more robust in the case of an organised avoidance response (wall-rearing) than in the case of a reflexive response (limb withdrawal); in the case of the former, latency data showed an effect on both males and females while frequency data showed an effect only in females. Overall, the O3 effects are suggestive of subtle {CNS} changes affecting mouse behavioural responses.},

More specifically, pups that were deprived of nutrition but not of maternal care as well as pups that were dehydrated ingested significantly more than nondeprived animals, and did so whether liquid diet was spread over the entire floor surface beneath them or restricted to a fraction of the floor surface. However, pups that had been nutritionally and maternally deprived were not able to direct their feeding. The general locomotor activation of pups in this latter group appeared to interfere with their ability to direct their behavior to the restricted source. These results indicate that from early ages, developing rats possess the appetitive competence to guide their behavior and suggest that previous findings of poorly directed behavior were a confound of the behavioral activation shown by pups tested in a state of maternal deprivation.},

These core symptoms are caused by maternal allele disruptions of a single gene-{UBE3A.} {UBE3A} encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets certain proteins for proteasomal degradation. This biology has led to the expectation that the identification of Ube3a protein targets will lead to therapies for Angelman syndrome. The recent discovery of Ube3a substrates such as Arc (activity-regulated cytoskeletal protein) provides new insight into the mechanisms underlying the synaptic function and plasticity deficits caused by the loss of Ube3a. In addition to identifying Ube3a substrates, there have also been recent advances in understanding {UBE3A's} integrated role in the neuronal repertoire of genes and protein interactions. A developmental picture is now emerging whereby {UBE3A} gene dosage on chromosome 15 alters synaptic function, with deficiencies leading to Angelman syndrome and overexpression associated with classic autism symptomatology.},

In the present study, we examined spontaneous alternation of mice who had been exposed to {PhB} prenatally or neonatally. Prenatal {PhB} was administered transplacentally: pregnant females were fed 3 g {PhB/kg} milled food on gestation days 9-18. Neonates were treated directly with daily injections of 50 mg {PhB/kg} on postnatal days 2-22. The animals were tested for spontaneous alternation in a T maze at the ages of 22, 28, 35 and 42 days. The test was conducted at each age for two consecutive days. A maximum of four alternations were allowed on the first day, and one alternation on the second day. Animals treated neonatally had reductions in alternation from the control group for every age group. Looking at the mean of the four trials on the first day there was a reduction of 35\% at age 22 (P{\textless}0.001), 8\% at age 28, 21\% at age 35 (P{\textless}0.05) and 36\% at age 42 (P{\textless}0.02). On the second day the respective reductions were 32, 19, 24 and 36\% (P{\textless}0.05). The differences in alternation between animals treated with {PhB} prenatally and the control group were too small to reach statistical significance. Subsequently a more sensitive test, delayed spontaneous alternation (30s), was applied to an additional group of animals at age 42 which had been prenatally exposed to {PhB:} 31\% reduction from the control group was found on day 1 (P{\textless}0.001), and 34\% on day 2 (P{\textless}0.02). The greater differences after neonatal as opposed to prenatal administration could be related to the more extensive hippocampal damage that was found in adults after neonatal treatment.},

This projection is overactive in lactation and is thought to drive hyperphagia in this condition. We have explored further the relationship between hypothalamic {NPY} and food intake in lactation and tested the hypothesis that hypoinsulinemia is the stimulus to {NPY} neuronal activity. Compared with nonlactating controls (n = 10), freely fed lactating rats (n = 9) showed significantly increased (p {\textless} 0.05) {NPY} levels in the {ARC} and medial preoptic area ({MPO)}, but there was no significant increase in whole hypothalamic {NPY} {mRNA} levels. Lactating rats (n = 8) that were restricted to control rats' food intake for 3 days showed generally higher hypothalamic {NPY} levels, with significantly higher concentrations then controls (p {\textless} 0.05) in the {ARC}, {MPO}, {PVN}, and lateral hypothalamic area ({LHA);} {NPY} {mRNA} levels were also significantly increased (p {\textless} 0.05). Across all three experimental groups, there was a significant inverse correlation between plasma insulin concentration and hypothalamic {NPY} {mRNA} levels (r = -0.39, p {\textless} 0.01). We conclude that the {ARC-PVN} projection is overactive in lactation and that this is not a consequence of hyperphagia.

	abstract = {The pulsatile luteinizing hormone ({LH)} and testosterone secretions were studied during serial blood collections performed at 7-min time intervals in the male rat. In fed rats, a discontinuous pattern of {LH} secretion was observed. Periods without secretion alternated with active secretory episodes consisting in trains of three to four {LH} peaks that triggered testosterone secretion usually 1-2 h later. The magnitude of the testosterone response was not correlated with the amplitude of the {LH} peaks. Isolated, single peaks of {LH} did not evoke clear testosterone responses. Forty-eight hours after initiation of fasting, testosterone secretion was markedly decreased, but integrated {LH} secretion was only partly reduced. Chronic infusion of neuropeptide Y ({NPY;} 18 μg/day, icv) reduced testosterone secretion to very low levels and abolished pulsatile {LH} secretion or testosterone response to isolated {LH} peaks. In conclusion, the stimulation of testosterone secretion by {LH} necessitates several {LH} peaks organized in a proper sequence, and the testosterone response is not immediate. Low testosterone secretion in fasting rats appears to result from disappearance of coordinated, multiple {LH} peaks of sufficient size. Inhibition of the gonadotropic axis achieved by central {NPY} administration is due to either absence of {LH} peak 'clusters' or occurrence of nonfunctional single {LH} peaks.},

These models can be categorised as those which show a poor response to different antiepileptic drugs and those in which subgroups of drug-resistant animals are selected, based on interindividual differences. Non-responders to antiepileptic drugs have been described in the amygdala kindling model, as well as the chronic phase of post-status epilepticus models. Epileptic dogs which do not respond to standard antiepileptic drugs may serve as a translational model to provide a more clinical environment for drug testing. Drug resistance or a poor response to several antiepileptic drugs has been reported for the 6-Hz model, lamotrigine-pretreated kindled rats, pentylentetrazole-induced seizures in rats pre-exposed to pilocarpine, as well as following intrauterine exposure of rats to methylazoxymethanol. Using models to select non-responders is highly time-consuming and elaborate, limiting their use in routine drug-screening procedures. Current efforts to identify biomarkers of drug resistance may simplify the selection process, e. g. replacing several weeks of seizure monitoring by a single imaging scan. Moreover, further elucidation of mechanisms of resistance may help to design a series of ex vivo or in vitro screening procedures in order to evaluate whether a test compound is affected.},

However, compound 77/250 did not provoke any significant effect on the fertility of rats. Interestingly, compound 78/224 and 78/702 evoked 100\% anti-implantation activity at doses of 10 and 5 mg/kg on the 7 day schedule. Of these two compounds, 78/702 (1,2,-diethyl-1,3-bis-(p-methoxyphenyl)-1-propene) exhibited more consistent results when the minimum effective dose ({MED)} on 5-day or 3-day (1-3 or 3-5) schedules was 1.5 mg/kg/day and on the single dose regimen 6 mg/kg. Compound 78/702 showed a significant estrogenic property at its {MED} when tested in immature rats by the uterine wt and vaginal cornification method; however, it did not exhibit any significant antiestrogenic or progestational activity. It interfered with the action of progesterone in the 'delayed implantation' test and cannot be considered as 'frank estrogenic'. The compound had the insignificant effect on foetal development and litter size. Possible mechanisms of anti-implantation activity of compound 78/702 have been discussed.},

	volume = {27},
	abstract = {Evidence is presented suggesting that carbonic anhydrase and zinc affect the deposition of otoconia, or calcium carbonate crystals, during otolith development in mice. A single injection of dichlorophenamide (an inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase) into pregnant {Swiss/COX} albino females at a specific day of gestation (13-18) produced otolith defects in the progeny as observed shortly after birth. Similar defects were found in progeny of pregnant females fed zinc-deficient diets beginning at various days of gestation (0, 10-16). Despite the highly significant effects of the drug and of the zinc-deficient diet, untreated controls exhibited a low incidence (approximately 15\%) of otolith defects. Various purified diets were employed to measure the effects of varying ratios of manganese and zinc on otoliths. Diets fortified with manganese plus zinc completely eliminated otolith defects. All other diets employed, significantly reduced the incidence of defects. It is postulated that: (1) the most active rate of crystal formation occurs during days 15 and 16 of gestation; (2) an observed asymmetry may reflect differences in the rate of development of ear primordia, or in levels of carbonic anhydrase activity; (3) the otoconia may undergo a rapid metabolic turnover, or they may be affected by subtle changes in {pH} of the endolymph; and (4) manganese and zinc are essential for normal otolith development. © 1972.},

	volume = {105},
	abstract = {Since the introduction of the thrifty phenotype hypothesis, the potential traits of thrift have been described in increasingly broad terms but biochemical and behavioral evidence of thrift has not been well demonstrated. The objective of our studies was to use a rodent model to identify features of thrift programmed by early life protein restriction. Robust programming of thrifty features requires a thrifty nutritional environment during the entire window of developmental plasticity. Therefore, pregnant rats were exposed to a low protein diet throughout the window of developmental plasticity spanning the period of gestation and lactation and its effects on energy acquisition, storage and expenditure in the adult offspring were examined. Maternal protein restriction reduced birth weight and produced long term reductions in body and organ weights in the offspring. Low protein offspring demonstrated an increased drive to seek food as evidenced by hyperphagia that was mediated by changes in plasma leptin and ghrelin levels. Hyperphagia was accompanied by increased efficiency in converting caloric intake into body mass. The higher feed efficiency was mediated by greater insulin sensitivity. Energy expenditure of low protein offspring in locomotion was not affected either in the light or dark phase. However, low protein offspring exhibited higher resting and basal metabolic rates as evidenced by higher core body temperature in the fed and fasted states. The increased thermogenesis was not mediated by thyroid hormones but by an increased sympathetic nervous system drive as reflected by a lower areal bone mineral density and bone mineral content and lower plasma adiponectin and triglyceride levels. Elevated thermogenesis in the low protein offspring possibly offsets the effects of hyperphagia, minimizes their chances of weight gain, and improves survivability. This constellation of metabolic features in the low protein offspring will maximize survival potential in a post natal environment of nutritional scarcity and constitute a thrifty phenotype.

Fifty-six neonatal {IUGR} rats and 24 neonatal normal rats were randomly divided into normal control group (C group), {IUGR} model group ({SC} group), low protein diet {IUGR} group ({SL} group), and high protein diet {IUGR} group ({SH} group). Eight rats were killed per group at wk 0, 4, and 12. Serum leptin, body weight ({BW)}, body length ({BL)}, intestinal weight ({IW)}, intestinal length ({IL)}, and intestinal disaccharidase (including lactase, maltase, and saccharase) were detected. {RESULTS:} {BW} (4.50 +/- 0.41 g), {BL} (5.96 +/- 0.40 cm), {IW} (0.05 +/- 0.01 g), and {IL} (15.9 +/- 2.8 cm) in neonatal {IUGR} rats were much lower than those in C group (6.01 +/- 0.55 g, 6.26 +/- 0.44 cm, 0.10 +/- 0.02 g, 21.8 +/- 2.7 cm, P{\textless}0.05), while intestinal lactase and maltase activities were higher than those in C group. {SH} group showed the fastest catch up growth and their {BW}, {BL}, {IW}, and {IL} reached the C group level at wk 4. {SC} group showed relatively slower catch up growth than {SH} group, and their {BW}, {BL}, {IW} did not reach the C group level at wk 4. {SL} group did not show intestine and body catch up growth. Intestinal maltase [344 +/- 33 mu mol/(min.g)] and saccharase activities [138 +/- 32 mu mol/(min.g)] in {SL} group were both markedly lower than those in C group [751 +/- 102, 258 +/- 27 mu mol/(min.g), P{\textless}0.05]. There were no significant differences in lactase activities at wk 4 and disaccharidase activities at wk 12 among all groups (P{\textgreater}0.05). The leptin level in {SL} group (0.58 +/- 0.12 {ng/mL)} was the highest in all groups, and much lower in {SH} group (0.21 +/- 0.03 {ng/mL)} than that in any other {IUGR} groups at wk 4 (P{\textless}0.05). Leptin was negatively related to {BW} (r = -0.556, P = 0.001), {IW} (r = -0.692, P = 0.001) and {IL} (r = -0.738, P = 0.000) at wk 4, while no correlation was found at wk 12. {CONCLUSION:} High protein diet is a reasonable early nutritional mode to {IUGR} rats in promoting intestine and body catch up growth.

	volume = {21},
	abstract = {Mammillary bodies and the mammillothalamic tract are parts of a classic neural circuitry that has been implicated in severe memory disturbances accompanying Korsakoff's syndrome. However, the specific role of mammillary bodies in memory functions remains controversial, often being considered as just an extension of the hippocampal memory system. To study this issue we used mutant mice with a targeted mutation in the transcription factor gene Foxb1. These mice suffer perinatal degeneration of the medial and most of the lateral mammillary nuclei, as well as of the mammillothalamic bundle. Foxb1 mutant mice showed no deficits in such hippocampal-dependent tasks as contextual fear conditioning and social transmission of food preference. They were also not impaired in the spatial reference memory test in the radial arm maze. However, Foxb1 mutants showed deficits in the task for spatial navigation within the Barnes maze. Furthermore, they showed impairments in spatial working memory tasks such as the spontaneous alternation and the working memory test in the radial arm maze. Thus, our behavioural analysis of Foxb1 mutants suggests that the medial mammillary nuclei and mammillothalamic tract play a role in a specific subset of spatial tasks, which require combined use of both spatial and working memory functions. Therefore, the mammillary bodies and the mammillothalamic tract may form an important route through which the working memory circuitry receives spatial information from the hippocampus.},

	title = {Deviations in brain development due to caloric undernutrition and scope of their prevention by rehabilitation: Alterations in the power spectra of the {EEG} of areas of the neocortex and limbic system},
	volume = {37},
	abstract = {Wistar rats underwent caloric undernutrition so as to produce undernourished pups (F1, both male and female), which were put on a reduced diet throughout life, causing deficits in body weight of 40-70\%, and in brain weight of 14-20\% by adulthood. These chronic undernourished rats were mated and their progeny (F2), which had suffered gestational and postnatal undernutrition, were undernourished, like their parents, throughout life until the moment of use in this study. At this degree of chronic undernutrition, rats do not appear to be sick or morbid, but only small-for-age, they are active and can reproduce. The computer-generated power spectra of the {EEG} of two neocortical areas (visual and motor) and of 3 regions of the limbic system (cingulate, hippocampus and olfactory bulb) of the chronically undernourished pups were obtained at different ages from birth to adulthood, and compared with the normal ontogenetic patterns of corresponding areas obtained from age-matched controls. In another group of rats, the undernutrition was imposed on normal pups from the day of weaning (21st day), i.e., after the major part of the brain growth spurt is over. Finally, the effect of restituting normal rehabilitatory nutrition from the day of weaning on the chronic group was also studied. The results show that all brain regions studied were affected by the chronic caloric undernutrition. The deviations from the normal consist of: (1) an initial lag or delay in the development of the {EEG} amplitude and activity by several days, (2) a later development of an abnormally high amplitude or power in the {EEG} power spectra by about the weaning age, and (3) an imbalance in the occurrence of the characteristics of the {EEG} of the respective areas of the brain (the low and high frequency spindles of slow sleep, the slow and fast theta activities of paradoxical sleep of the hippocampus, the delta rhythm, etc.). While the chronic undernutrition was continuing there was also a certain degree of spontaneous reduction in the magnitude of abnormality after about 80 days of age, insted of worsening with age, perhaps due to an intrinsic adaptational readjustment to the stress of the nutritional deprivation. The results reveal a variation in the susceptibility of development to these abnormalities. Typical examples of the range of variation of the effects are presented in the results showing that there can be nearly normal {EEG} patterns in some undernourished subjects (about 14-22\%), and also that there can be abnormal {EEG} power spectra in a proportion of normals (up to about 20\%). These results imply that there is a range in the plasticity and adaptive mechanisms underlying the cerebral functional reorganization evoked by chronic food deprivation. Rehabilitated groups have shown only a partial reduction in the {EEG} power abnormality. It is concluded that the chronic caloric undernutrition at an early age can impart permanent shifts in the organization of cerebral functioning, and that the post-growth spurt rehabilitatory feeding can contribute only little to reverse or reduce the effects of the previous undernutrition.},

	abstract = {Although the morphological teratogenic actions of ethanol have been well established in mice, studies on the behavioral teratogenic effects of alcohol have been primarily conducted with rats. The purpose of this study was to examine the behavioral effects of prenatal alcohol exposure in C57 mice, a strain known to be highly sensitive to the teratogenic actions of ethanol. Pregnant mice were administered a liquid diet containing 25\% ethanol-derived calories ({EDC)} from day 5 through day 18 of gestation. Control animals were pair-fed an isocaloric 0\% {EDC} diet during the same period of time, with sucrose substituted for ethanol. At 23 days of age, offspring were tested for spontaneous locomotor activity in an open field. At 70 days of age, different offspring were tested in a shuttle-avoidance task. The results demonstrated that the 25\% {EDC} progeny were more active than controls. In addition, prenatal alcohol exposure produced a deficit in acquisition and performance of a shuttle-avoidance task. Alcohol-treated offspring made fewer avoidance responses and required more trials to reach a criterion performance of 10/10 avoidances consecutively followed by at least 9/10 avoidances. These results importantly contribute to the development of an animal model of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome in which both the behavioral and morphological consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure may be assessed in the same species.},

Two additional free-fed groups, as well as a pair-fed group, were employed. Food and water intake was recorded in treated groups. Results indicated that only the high dose alcohol produced a significant decrease in fetal body weight and a significant elevation of the incidence of kidney and limb malformations. These effects could not be attributed to restricted food intake. Cocaine was not found to produce any significant perturbations of development, either alone or in combination with alcohol.

Protein-deficient dams were fed a 4\%, instead of a 24\%, casein diet. For controls at 21 days of age, the 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide-3'-phosphohydrolase activity was more than fivefold greater in white matter than in gray matter. Severe undernutrition (protein-deficient) gave 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide-3'-phosphohydrolase activities that were 36\% lower in gray matter and 56\% lower in white matter. Lipid galactose concentrations were 17\% less than control in both gray matter and white matter. In protein-deficient white matter, phospholipid concentrations were 15\% lower than control. Ethanolamine plasmalogens and phosphatidyl serine were affected most. Moderate undernutrition (large litter) had no effect on 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide-3'-phosphohydrolase activity. A 14\% deficit of galactolipids was the only difference from controls in large-litter white matter. In large litter gray matter, phospholipid concentrations were 16\% higher than controls.

	abstract = {Chronic administration of anorexigenic substances to experimental animals by injections or continuous infusion typically produces either no effect or a transient reduction in food intake and body weight. Our aim here was to identify an intermittent dosing strategy for intraperitoneal infusion of peptide {YY(3-36)} [{PYY(3-36)]} that produces a sustained reduction in daily food intake and adiposity in diet-induced obese rats. Rats (665 ± 10 g body wt, 166 ± 7 g body fat) with intraperitoneal catheters tethered to infusion swivels had free access to a high-fat diet. Vehicle-treated rats (n = 23) had relatively stable food intake, body weight, and adiposity during the 9-wk test period. None of 15 {PYY(3-36)} dosing regimens administered in succession to a second group of rats (n = 22) produced a sustained 15-25\% reduction in daily food intake for {\textgreater}5 days, although body weight and adiposity were reduced across the 9-wk period by 12\% (594 ± 15 vs. 672 ± 15 g) and 43\% (96 ± 7 vs. 169 ± 9 g), respectively. The declining inhibitory effect of {PYY(3-36)} on daily food intake when the interinfusion interval was ≥3 h appeared to be due in part to an increase in food intake between infusions. The declining inhibitory effect of {PYY(3-36)} on daily food intake when the interinfusion interval was {\textless} 3 h suggested possible receptor downregulation and tolerance to frequent {PYY(3-36)} administration; however, food intake significantly increased when {PYY(3-36)} treatments were discontinued for 1 day following apparent loss in treatment efficacies. Together, these results demonstrate the development of a potent homeostatic response to increase food intake when {PYY(3-36)} reduces food intake and energy reserves in diet-induced obese rats.},

	volume = {19},
	abstract = {The daily ingestion of alcohol by pregnant mammals exposes the fetal brain to varying levels of alcohol through the placental circulation. Here we focus on the lingering impact on cortical function of 6.5\% alcohol administered in a liquid diet to pregnant rats throughout gestation, followed by 3 alcohol-free months before brain function was analyzed in the offspring. Both spontaneous activity of the neurons in the barrel cortex and the level of response to test stimuli applied to the whiskers remained reduced by {\textgreater}75\% after alcohol exposure. Whisker pairing, a type of cortical plasticity induced by trimming all but two whiskers in adult rats, occurred in {\textless}1 d in controls, but required 14 d to reach significance after alcohol exposure. These long-term neuronal deficits are present in all layers of cortex and affect neurons with both fast and slow action potentials. Plasticity is first seen in the total sample of neurons at 14 d; however, by 7 d, neurons in layer {II/III} already show plasticity, with no change in layer {IV} neurons, and a reverse shift occurs toward the inactive whisker in layer V neurons. Analysis of {NMDA} receptor subunits shows a persistent, similar to 30-50\% reduction of {NR1}, {NR2A}, and {NR2B} subunits at postnatal day 90 in the barrel field cortex. Exposing the prenatal alcohol-exposed rats to enriched rearing conditions significantly improves all measured cortical functions but does not restore normal values. The results predict that combinations of interventions will be necessary to completely restore cortical function after exposure of the fetal brain to alcohol.},

	abstract = {Three subtypes of neurotensin receptor have been described, two members of the heptahelical transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptor superfamily {NT-1R} and {NT-2R}, and {NT-3R} unrelated to this family. We have generated {NT-1R} deficient ({NT-1R-/-)} mice. {NT-1R-/-} mice were born at the expected Mendelian frequency without obvious abnormalities and they were fertile. The {NT-induced} analgesia on the writhing induced by phenyl-p-benzoquinone administration remained at wild-type levels in the {NT-1R-/-} mice demonstrating that the {NT-1R} is not implicated in the analgesic effect of {NT} in this test. The {NT-1R-/-} mice were hyperthermic; their body temperature was not affected by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of {NT}, contrasting with the hypothermia induced in {NT-1R+/+} mice. {NT-1R-/-} mice showed a small significant increase in body weight compared to the {NT-1R+/+} congeners as early as 10 weeks after birth, correlated with a higher food intake. {NT-1R-/-} mice showed similar spontaneous locomotion to the control littermates, but did not respond to i.c.v. {NT-induced} hypolocomotion. I.c.v. injection of {NT} inhibited feeding in fasted wild-type mice, but had no effect on feeding of the {NT-1R-/-} mice. I.c.v. administration of the orexigenic neuropeptide Y ({NPY)} stimulated feeding to the same extent in both wild-type and {NT-1R-/-} mice. This analysis of {NT-1R-deficient} mice shows that the {NT-1R} does not play a role in {NT-induced} analgesia, but that it is clearly implicated in thermal and feeding regulation, weight control, and {NT-induced} hypolocomotion. © 2002 Elsevier Science {B.V.} All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Maternal stress and malnutrition modify intrauterine fetal development with impact on postnatal blood pressure, nutrient, water, and electrolyte metabolism. The present study explored the possible involvement of maternal serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase ({SGK)-1} in fetal programming of blood pressure. To this end, wild-type (sgk1 +/+) male mice were mated with {SGK1} knockout (sgk1 -/-) female mice, and sgk1 -/- males with sgk1 +/+ females, resulting in both cases in heterozygotic (sgk1 -/+) offspring. Following prenatal protein restriction, the offspring of sgk1 +/+ mothers gained weight significantly slower and had significantly higher blood pressure after birth. Moreover, a sexual dimorphism was apparent in fasting blood glucose and plasma corticosterone concentrations, with higher levels in female offspring. In contrast, prenatal protein restriction of sgk1 -/- mothers had no significant effect on postnatal weight gain, blood pressure, plasma glucose concentration, or corticosterone levels, irrespective of offspring sex. Plasma aldosterone concentration, urinary flow rates, and urinary excretions of Na + and K + were not significantly modified by either maternal genotype or nutritional manipulation. In conclusion, maternal signals mediated by {SGK1} may play a decisive role in fetal programming of hypertension induced by prenatal protein restriction.

	volume = {7},
	abstract = {Ketogenic diet ({KD)} is used to manage intractable epilepsy; however, the mechanisms underlying its therapeutic effects are not known. Steroid hormones, such as progesterone and testosterone, are derived from cholesterol, and are readily 5α-reduced to dihydroprogesterone and dihydrotestosterone, which are subsequently converted to 5α-pregnan-3α-ol-20-one (3α,5α-{THP)} and 3α-androstanediol, neuroactive steroids that can influence seizures. The present study examined the effects of the {KD} on circulating concentrations of these neuroactive steroids, and their precursors, in intact female rats. Thirty-six, 22-day-old female Sprague-Dawley rats (weaned at 21 days) were fasted for 8 hours prior to placement on one of three dietary regimens for 6 weeks: ad libitum chow, calorie-restricted chow, or {KD.} After 6 weeks of the diet, when six rats in each dietary condition were in diestrus and six were in behavioral estrus, all rats were administered pentylenetetrazole ({PTZ}, 70 mg/kg, {IP).} The latency and incidence of seizures were recorded by an observer who was uninformed of the estrous cycle and dietary treatment conditions of the rats. Immediately after each test, trunk blood was obtained for later measurement of pregnane (progesterone, dihydroprogesterone, 3α,5α-{THP)} and androstane (testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, 3α-androstanediol) neuroactive steroid concentrations in plasma by radioimmunoassay. {KD} tended to lengthen the latency to, and significantly reduced the number of, {PTZ-induced} barrel roll seizures. {KD} also significantly reduced plasma levels of the pregnane (dihydroprogesterone, 3α,5α-{THP)} and androstane (dihydrotestosterone, 3α-androstanediol) 5α-reduced metabolites. These data suggest that levels of pregnane and androstane neuroactive steroids, or their precursors, may underlie some of the antiseizure effects of {KD.} © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	volume = {87},
	abstract = {Muscular dysgenesis (mdg) in the mouse is a recessive autosomal mutation affecting the striated musculature: during the whole gestation period, the muscles never show any sign of contractile activity. They are cytologically immature at birth, although the diaphragm is more mature than limb muscles, as confirmed by the levels of creatine phosphokinase. In both limb muscles and diaphragm the cytochemical localization of acetylcholinesterase demonstrates focal accumulations on the entire surface of mdg/mdg muscles, whereas such foci of acetylcholinesterase activity are restricted to a narrow end plate-rich region in +/mdg? diaphragms. Teased single mdg/mdg myofiber preparations show that one myofiber can possess several foci of acetylcholinesterase, generally presenting aspects of very immature motor end plates. A study of the motor innervation, after silver nitrate impregnation, provides evidence for a spectacular overgrowth and a generalized sprouting of mdg/mdg nerves and axons. The mdg/mdg nerve terminals are generally very immature-looking, with an intense ultraterminal sprouting. Aspects suggesting a denser multiple innervation of mdg/mdg than +/mdg? myofibers have been observed and choline acetyltransferase activity is increased in mdg/mdg tissues. Acetylcholinesterase specific activity and the number of α-bungarotoxin binding sites per milligram protein increased in mdg/mdg compared to +/mdg? diaphragms. The very low amount of 16 S (and 12 S) acetylcholinesterase is probably related to mdg/mdg muscle inactivity. If the cytological and biochemical data are compared, it seems possible to propose that mdg/mdg myofibers and axons are in contact in several regions of the same myofiber, in variably mature appositions, and with a very dense multi-innervation.},

	abstract = {We present genetic analyses of murine weight loss during dietary restriction ({DR)} for females eating 60\% ad libitum ({AL).} We examined 5 cohorts across 81 different strains (22 strains tested twice) that included the {LXS} and {LSXSS} recombinant inbred strains, the {LXS} parental strains {ILS} and {ISS}, and the classical inbreds {129S6}, A, {BALB/c}, {C57BL/6}, {C3H}, and {DBA.} Weight loss exhibited highly significant genetic variation, with {DR} body weights ranging from ∼60 to ∼85\% of {AL} body weight. This variation was not explained by the strain differences in absolute food intake, feces calorie content, motor activity, or {AL} body fat. Heritability was 40-50\%, and several provisional quantitative trait loci were mapped. This variation can be used to test whether weight loss correlates with the health benefits of {DR}, independently of the reduction in calories. The genetic variation also implies the existence of genes that would be novel therapeutic targets, distinct from genes affecting {AL} body weight or body fat, for enhancing (or mitigating) weight loss during food restriction.

The results demonstrated that prenatal alcohol exposure produced a facilitation in the acquisition of this task at both ages. The 35\% {EDC} offspring made significantly more responses than controls and received fewer shocks. In addition, an analysis of interresponse times for the older animals revealed that the 35\% {EDC} group learned to space their responses better than control animals. Possible explanations of the facilitation in Sidman avoidance shown by the 35\% {EDC} progeny are discussed in terms of an inhibition deficit.},

	abstract = {The long-term effect of transplanting embryonic frontal cortex into a unilateral frontal cortex lesion has been studied in adult rats. Before surgery, activity in an open field, muscular strength of both forelimbs, and performance in a paw-reaching-for-food task were scored in 26 rats. In 21 animals a unilateral cortex lesion was then made in the forelimb motor area of the hemisphere contralateral to the preferred paw in the paw-reaching-for-food task, while the other 5 animals were sham-operated. On retesting, the lesion animals changed the preferred paw. A solid homotopic transplant of embryonic tissue (embryonic day 17) was then placed in the lesion cavity in 11 of the lesion rats. Three months later neither lesion alone nor Lesion plus transplantation affected open field behavior and muscular strength, but the lesion permanently affected performance in the paw-reaching-for-food task, as shown by a change of preferred paw and a functional deficit in the paw contralateral to the lesion. Transplantation ameliorated the deficits caused by the lesion, but this was only evident when animals were forced to reach with the paw contralateral to the lesion plus transplant. The behavioral results were independent of the size of the lesion and graft. Connections between graft and host tissue were studied by means of the fluorescent tracer 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3'3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate ({DiI).} A dense array of labeled fibers was found in the host cortex adjacent to the transplant. The results suggest that functional recovery depends on grafting but is only evident when the animal is obliged to use the affected limb. (C) 2001 Academic Press.},

Starting at 6 p.m. and ending at 6 a.m., on days 3, 6, 12, 15, 18 and 21 of lactation, photos were taken at 4-s intervals. An increase in the frequency (154.88 +/- 16.19) and duration (455.86 +/- 18.05 min) of suckling was observed throughout the lactation period in all groups compared to birth day (frequency 24.88 +/- 2.37 and duration 376.76 +/- 21.01 min), but the frequency was higher in the C (84.96 +/- 8.52) than in the M group (43.13 +/- 4.37); however, the M group (470.2 +/- 11.87 min) spent more time suckling as compared with the C group (393.67 +/- 13.09 min). The M darns showed a decreased frequency of resting position throughout the lactation period (6.5 +/- 2.48) compared to birth day (25.42 +/- 7.74). Pups from the C group were more frequently observed separated (73.02 +/- 4.38) and interacting (258.99 +/- 20.61) more with their mothers than the M pups (separated 66.94 +/- 5.5 and interacting 165.72 +/- 12.05). Tactile stimulation did not interact with diet condition, showing that the kind of stimulation used in the present study did not lead to recovery from the changes induced by protein malnutrition. The changes in mother-pup interaction produced by protein malnutrition of both may represent retardation in neuromotor development and a higher dependence of the pups on their mothers. These changes may represent an important means of energy saving and heat maintenance in malnourished pups.},

In the present study the effect of test conditions on pup retrieval behavior of mothers receiving a 25\% (well-nourished group) and 8\% casein diet (undernourished group) was examined. In agreement with previous studies, undernourished mothers spent more time with their litters than well-nourished dams as lactation proceeded. Pup retrieval behavior varied with test conditions. In the first experiment, the maternal behavior of dams was assessed by the standard procedure (pups were separated from their mother and scattered over the floor of the home cage). The mother was then returned and the number of retrieved pups was recorded. From day 3 to 8, the retrieval efficiency of undernourished dams decreased, while the retrieval efficiency of well-nourished mothers did not vary. In the second experiment, mothers were subjected to a single retrieval test (on day 9 of lactation) using the procedure described for experiment 1. No difference between well-nourished and undernourished mothers was observed. In the third experiment, seven-day-old pups were separated from the mothers and returned individually to a clean home cage. Dietary treatment did not affect the retrieval efficiency, However, undernourished dams reconstructed the nest more slowly than did well-nourished dams. Taken together, these results suggest that pup retrieval behavior of the undernourished mother is not impaired by dietary restriction when the maternal environment is disturbed minimally.},

	volume = {18},
	abstract = {Previous work suggested that in mouse, presumptive targets of the trigeminal ganglion, rather than intermediate structures, attract pioneer axons from the time their growth cones exit the ganglion (Lumsden and Davies, 1986). In rat we find that some presumptive targets repel trigeminal axons. The repellant activity is concentrated in the anterior and ventral epithelium of the mandibular arch at embryonic day 12 (E12) and was also present in the maxillary arch. The activity is blocked by antineuropilin-1. E13 mandible explants repel trigeminal axons during the first day of outgrowth in vitro, but thereafter permit or attract trigeminal ganglion axon outgrowth. By E14, lingual nerve afferents first enter the tongue in vivo, and the repellant influence becomes restricted to the midline. The progressive restriction of the repellant influence may contribute to the in vivo progression of nerve development: the earliest afferents turn anteriorly lateral to the tongue, but subsequently arriving afferents advance into the tongue and then turn away from the midline. Thus, the repellant may influence the order of nerve branch development and the timing of innervation of epithelial and subepithelial targets. Heterochronic studies revealed that the loss of repellant influence from presumptive lateral tongue surface results from downregulation of the repellant activity, not of responsiveness to the repellant. Because presumptive targets repel trigeminal axons during the initial stages of advance from the trigeminal ganglion and do not have a net attractive influence until after afferents have arrived near the target, intermediate structures must guide these axons initially.},

	abstract = {Developmental exposure to the organophosphorus pesticides chlorpyrifos and diazinon ({DZN)} alters serotonergic synaptic function at doses below the threshold for cholinesterase inhibition, however there are some indications that the two agents may differ in several important attributes. Previously, we found that low-dose chlorpyrifos exposure in neonatal rats causes lasting changes in emotional response and in the current study we did a comparable evaluation for {DZN.} Male and female Sprague-Dawley rat pups (N = 10-12 of each sex per treatment group) were given 0, 0.5 or 2 mg/(kg day) of {DZN} s.c. daily on postnatal days ({PND)} 1-4. These doses bracket the threshold for barely-detectable cholinesterase inhibition. Starting on {PND} 52, these rats began a battery of tests to assess emotional reactivity. In the elevated plus maze, there was a slight decrease in the time spent in the open arms for {DZN-exposed} males, while {DZN-exposed} females were not different from control females. In the novelty-suppressed feeding test, {DZN-exposed} males had significantly shorter latencies to begin eating than did control males, reducing the values to those normally seen in females. {DZN-exposed} rats of either sex showed reduced preference for chocolate milk in the anhedonia test that compared the consumption of chocolate milk to water. These findings show that neonatal exposures to {DZN} at a dose range below the threshold for cholinesterase inhibition nevertheless evokes specific, later alterations in emotional behaviors, particularly in males. The effects show not only some similarities to those of chlorpyrifos but also some differences, in keeping with neurochemical findings comparing the two agents. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

At 2 months of age, arterial blood pressure was recorded intravascularly using telemetry in awake and unrestrained animals over two 12-h night-time (active) and daytime (resting) periods. Aortic pulse wave velocity was assessed in six additional hypoxic pretreated and five control anesthetized 2-month-old male {rats.ResultsSystolic}, mean, and pulse pressures were significantly greater in the hypoxic pretreated group compared to the control group during resting and active periods in both sexes (P\&lt;0.05). Diastolic pressure and heart rate did not differ between the two groups. Hypoxic pretreated males displayed significantly increased blood pressure variability during the resting period. Aortic pulse wave velocity was also found to be elevated in the hypoxic pretreated {rats.ConclusionsProlonged} hypoxic stress in early life in the rat is associated with increased systolic arterial pressure at maturity very likely due to decreased arterial compliance. These findings suggest that a nutrient-independent, postnatal stress may lead to long-lasting vascular alterations predisposing to increased arterial pressure at maturity.

Systolic blood pressures were measured throughout pregnancy. On day 22 plasma Volume was measured and blood samples were taken for electrolyte and hormonal measurements. Fetal and placental weights were also determined. {RESULTS:} Plasma renin activity and aldosterone level were significantly higher in the experimental group than in the control group. Plasma volume was significantly lower in pregnant rats receiving a low-sodium than in those receiving a control diet. Rats receiving a low-sodium diet had pups of lower weight and length (4.45+/-0.22 g, 3.90 +/- 0.06 cm) than pups of the control group (5.21 +/- 0.12 g, 4.10 +/- 0.02 cm). Pups born to mothers with low-sodium diets recuperated from intrauterine growth restriction by 14 days after birth. {CONCLUSION:} These data indicate that a low-sodium diet given to pregnant rats for the last 7 days of gestation leads to reduced plasma volume expansion and fetal growth restriction.

Because little is known about the effects of perinatal food restriction upon gustatory neuronal brain stem structures, we characterized neuronal Golgi-Cox alterations of the solitary tract rostral portion ({NSTr)} where gustatory information is known to convey in neonatal Wistar rats. Pre-and neonatally undernourished rats exhibited a general reduction in the number and extension of distal dendrites particularly in small neurons but little effect upon perikarya measurements of the {NSTr} neuronal population. By contrast, in nutritional and sensory rehabilitated rats the number of distal dendrites increased, although the dendritic extensions were less affected compared to perinatally underfed and control subjects. The data indicate that perinatal food restriction interferes with the {NSTr} dendritic arbor organization, while nutritional and sensorial rehabilitation given by normally lactating dams induced plastic changes presumably modifying the integrative processes underlying early taste discriminative capabilities. Moreover, since perinatal food restriction is a powerful stressor influence and the {NST} forms a part of a complex system underlying adaptive stress responses, the neuronal alterations observed here may be partly due to this noxious perinatal influence.},

The present studies were designed to confirm and expand earlier work on the intriguing behavioral profile of the {C58/J} inbred strain, including low social approach and aberrant repetitive movements. Additional tests were selected to reflect aspects of autism, a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by emergence of symptoms early in life, higher prevalence in males, social deficits and abnormal repetitive behavior. Mice from the {C57BL/6J} inbred strain, which has a similar genetic lineage and physical appearance to {C58/J}, served as a comparison group. Our results revealed that {C58/J} mice display elevated activity levels by postnatal day 6, which persist into adulthood. Despite normal olfactory ability, young adult male {C58/J} mice showed deficits in social approach in the three-chambered choice assay and failed to demonstrate social transmission of food preference. In contrast, female {C58/J} mice performed similarly to female {C57BL/6J} mice in both social tests. {C58/J} mice of both sexes demonstrated abnormal repetitive behaviors, displaying excessive Jumping and back flipping in both social and non-social situations. These stereotypies were clearly evident in {C58/J} pups by postnatal days 20-21, and were also observed in {C58/J} dams during a test for maternal behavior. Overall, the strain profile for {C58/J}, including spontaneously developing motor stereotypies emerging early in the developmental trajectory, and social deficits primarily in males, models multiple components of the autism phenotype.

	abstract = {In a series of studies on histaminergic functions in the hypothalamus, probes to manipulate activities of histaminergic neuron systems were applied to assess its physiologic and pathophysiologic implications using non-obese normal and Zucker obese rats, an animal model of genetic obesity. Food intake is suppressed by either activation of H-1-receptor or inhibition of the H-3-receptor in the ventromedial hypothalamus ({VMH)} or the paraventricular nucleus, each of which is involved in satiety regulation. Histamine neurons in the mesencephalic trigeminal sensory nucleus modulate masticatory functions, particularly eating speed through the mesencephalic trigeminal motor nucleus, and activation of the histamine neurons in the {VMH} suppress intake volume of feeding at meals. Energy deficiency in the brain, i.e., intraneuronal glucoprivation, activates neuronal histamine in the hypothalamus. Such low energy intake in turn accelerates glycogenolysis in the astrocytes to prevent the brain from energy deficit. Thus, both mastication and low energy intake act as afferent signals for activation of histaminergic nerve systems in the hypothalamus and result in enhancement of, satiation. There is a rationale for efficacy of a very-low-calorie conventional Japanese diet as a therapeutic tool for weight reduction. Feeding circadian rhythm is modulated by manipulation of hypothalamic histamine neurons. Hypothalamic histamine neurons are activated by an increase in ambient temperature. Hypothalamic neuronal histamine controls adaptive behavior including a decrease in food intake and ambulation, and an increase in water intake to maintain body temperature to be normally constant. In addition, interleukin-lp, an endogenous pyrogen, enhanced turnover of neuronal histamine through prostaglandin E-2 in the brain. Taken together, the histamine neuron system in the hypothalamus is essential for maintenance of thermoregulation through the direct and indirect control of adaptive behavior. Behavioral and metabolic abnormalities of obese Zucker rats including hyperphagia, disruption of feeding circadian rhythm, hyperlipidemia, hyperinsulinemia, and disturbance of thermoregulation are essentially derived from a defect in hypothalamic neuronal histamine. Abnormalities produced by depletion of neuronal histamine from the hypothalamus in normal rats mimick those of obese Zuckers. Grafting the lean Zucker fetal hypothalamus into the obese Zucker pups attenuates those abnormalities. These findings indicate that histamine nerve systems in the brain play a crucial role in maintaining homeostatic energy balance. (C) Elsevier Science Inc. 1997.},

In the present work we carried out experiments using an undernutrition model to establish if such microbial lipids can also play a role in accelerating the myelin process in hypomyelinated rats. This model was produced by restricting maternal dietary intake during the last 4 days of pregnancy and the lactating period. Diet-restricted dams were divided into 3 groups when pups were 14 days old. The first group was switched to ad libitum diet containing 9\% margarine and 1\% corn oil, the second to ad libitum feeding diet containing 10\% of microbial lipids and the third to ad libitum feeding standard diet containing 3\% of lipids. The offspring were sacrificed at differing days of nutritional rehabilitation. The recovery of the body and brain weight was slower in rats fed 3\% of lipids than animals maintained on 10\% of lipids. The test group showed an earlier increase both in the relative levels of proteolipid protein ({PLP)} and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein ({MOG)} {mRNAs} and in the 2′-3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′ phosphohydrolase ({CNPase)} activity compared with the other two groups. These results indicate that the reversal of myelin delay would seem to be accelerated in the group fed microbial lipids.},

	abstract = {Early postnatal nutrition has been associated with the long-term effects on glucose homeostasis in adulthood. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which undernutrition during early life leads to changes in insulin sensitivity, we investigated the insulin signaling in skeletal muscle of rats during development. Offspring of dams fed with either protein-free or normal diets during the first 10 days of lactation were studied from lactation period until adulthood. Early maternal undernutrition impaired secretion of insulin but maintained normal blood glucose levels until adulthood. Insulin receptor ({IR)} activation after insulin stimulation was decreased during the period of protein restriction. In addition, glucose uptake, insulin receptor substrate 1 ({IRS-1)} phosphorylation and glucose transporter 4 ({GLUT-4)} translocation in muscle were reduced in response to insulin during suckling. In contrast, non- or insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and {GLUT-4} translocation were found significantly increased in muscle of adult offspring. Finally, basal association of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ({PI3-kinase)} with {IRS-1} was increased and was highly stimulated by insulin in muscle from adult rats. Our findings suggest that early postnatal undernutrition increases insulin sensitivity in adulthood, which appears to be directly related to changes in critical steps required for glucose metabolism. © 2003 Elsevier {B.V.} All rights reserved.},

The four closely related small {GTP-binding} proteins {Rab3A}, {Rab3B}, {Rab3C}, and {Rab3D} are believed to be important for these steps. In mice, the complete absence of all Rab3s leads to perinatal lethality accompanied by a 30\% reduction of probability of Ca2+-triggered synaptic release. This study examines the role of Rab3 during Ca2+-triggered release in more detail and identifies its impact on short-term plasticity. Using patch-clamp electrophysiology of autaptic neuronal cultures from Rab3-deficient mouse hippocampus, we show that excitatory Rab3-deficient neurons display unique time- and frequency-dependent short-term plasticity characteristics in response to spike trains. Analysis of vesicle release and repriming kinetics as well as Ca2+ sensitivity of release indicate that Rab3 acts on a subset of primed, fusion competent vesicles. They lower the amount of Ca2+ required for action potential-triggered release, which leads to a boosting of release probability, but their action also introduces a significant delay in the supply of these modified vesicles. As a result, Rab3-induced modifications to primed vesicles causes a transient increase in the transduction efficacy of synaptic action potential trains and optimizes the encoding of synaptic information at an intermediate spike frequency range.},

	abstract = {The production of offspring typically requires investment of resources derived from both the environment and maternal somatic reserves. As such, the availability of either of these types of resources has the potential to limit the degree to which resources are allocated to reproduction. Theory and empirical studies have argued that mothers modify reproductive performance relative to exogenous resource availability and maternal condition by adjusting size, number or sex of offspring produced. These relationships have classically been defined relative to availability of energy sources; however, in vertebrates, calcium also plays a critical role in offspring production, as a considerable amount of calcium is required to support the development of offspring skeleton(s). We tested whether the availability of calcium influences reproductive output by providing female white-footed mice with a low-calcium or standard diet from reproductive maturity to senescence. We then compared maternal skeletal condition and reproductive output, based on offspring mass, offspring number and litter sex ratio, between dietary treatments. Mothers on the low-calcium diet exhibited diminished skeletal condition at senescence and produced smaller and strongly female-biased litters. We show that skeletal condition and calcium intake can influence sex ratio and reproductive output following general theoretical models of resource partitioning during reproduction.},

Rat pups received a daily subcutaneous injection of 10 mg/kg {DZP} or of the dissolution Vehicle from postnatal day (P) 2 to 21. Learning and memory were tested in P60-P70 rats on 5 consecutive days in a T maze and an eight arm maze while anxiety and reaction to novelty were tested in a 2 compartment box with a 2 step staircase on one side. Social behavior was evaluated in a condition of restricted access to food. {LCMRglcs} were measured at P60 by the quantitative autoradiographic [C-14]deoxyglucose method. In the T maze, when performed without delay between the 2 trials, the rate of alternation was significantly lower in {DZP} than in vehicle-exposed rats on the first 2 days of testing and similar in both groups on days 3-5. In the procedure with a 30 s intertrial delay, the rate of alternation was similar in {DZP} and vehicle-treated rats on all days of testing. In the eight arm maze, {DZP-treated} rats were more active, i.e. entering more arms per min than control animals. The number of arms entered before the first error was lower on day 1 and higher on day 3 in {DZP} compared to vehicle-exposed rats. In the 2 compartment box, {DZP-treated} rats crossed more often the lower step of the staircase and spent more time than controls on the 2 steps of the staircase while control rats made more rearings than {DZP-exposed} rats in the well protected corner of the box. {LCMRglcs} were decreased by early {DZP} exposure in several cortical regions, mammillary body, septum and dorsomedian caudate nucleus; in conclusion, an early chronic {DZP} treatment induces an increase inactivity only a delay but no impairment in learning and leads to a decrease in the level of anxiety and emotionality leading to an active response to novelty. These quite subtle behavioral changes are accompanied by discrete metabolic changes and probably reflect the state of hyperactivity/hyperarousal of these animals which could result from a change in the distribution, the sensitivity and/or function of {GABA-BZD} receptors.},

Transections lateral to the vmh which extended into the anterior hypothalamus produced behavioral changes similar but not identical to those resulting from vmh electrolytic destruction: hyperphagia and obesity, finickiness, altered food motivation, hyperirritability, and decreased wood gnawing. Lateral transections also produced a partial or temporary disruption in wheel running and estrous cycles in contrast to the severe impairments produced by vmh lesions. Lateral transections limited to the region between the ventromedial nucleus and lateral hypothalamus did not alter feeding behavior, but did effect reactivity and wood gnawing. The anterior and posterior cuts had no effects on feeding behavior, reactivity, or wheel running, but wood gnawing was depressed by posterior cuts, and disruptions in the estrous cycles were produced by anterior cuts.

	volume = {79},
	abstract = {Dehydration is a classic homeostatic stressor in rats that leads to a series of endocrine responses including stimulation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal ({HPA)} axis. During the last decade, it has been well established that perinatal food restriction is associated with the onset of diseases in adults. Our previous demonstration of long-term alterations in {HPA} axis activity in both basal conditions and after a 72-hour dehydration period in 4-month-old rats exposed to a 50\% maternal food restriction ({FR50)} in late gestation and lactation prompted us to investigate whether such perinatal undernutrition further affects {HPA} axis activity in mature animals. As previously described in 4-month-old rats under basal conditions, 8-month-old {FR50} rats showed reduced body weight and an enhanced ratio between mineralocorticoid receptor ({MR)} and glucocorticoid receptor ({GR)} {mRNA} levels in the hippocampus, as well as increased pro-opiomelanocortin ( {POMC)} {mRNA} levels in the adenohypophysis. In addition, numerous additional alterations appeared in mature rats. In the hypothalamus, levels of vasopressin ({VP)} {mRNAs} were increased both in the paraventricular nucleus ({PVN)} and in the supraoptic nucleus ( {SON).} In the adenohypophysis, {GR} and prohormone-convertase 2 ({PC2)} {mRNA} levels were significantly increased, whereas prohormone-convertase 1 ({PC1)} {mRNA} was not affected by maternal undernutrition. Interestingly, undernourished animals exhibited high plasma levels of total and free corticosterone in spite of normal corticotropin ( {ACTH)} levels, an indication that {HPA} basal activity is enhanced by maternal undernutrition in 8-month-old animals. Dehydration for 72 h induced a rise in {ACTH} plasma levels, but did not modify total and free corticosterone plasma levels in 8-month-old {FR50} animals. In the adenopituitary, {POMC} {mRNA} levels were decreased after dehydration but {PC1} {mRNA} levels were unaffected. The present study indicates that maternal food restriction during the perinatal period dramatically affects the activity of the {HPA} axis until the age of 8 months. We speculate that higher basal {HPA} activity and an inadequate {HPA} response after dehydration in mature animals may contribute to diseases such as hypertension, known to develop with aging in perinatally growth-restricted rats.

The {CB} 34-induced increase in the abundance of 3α,5α-{TH} {PROG} was more pronounced in the brain than in the plasma of isolated rats. Analysis of [ {3H]PK} 11195 binding to membranes prepared from the cerebral cortex, adrenals, or testis revealed no significant difference in either the maximal number of binding sites for this {PBR} ligand or its dissociation constant between isolated and group-housed animals. Social isolation also induced a small but significant decrease in the plasma concentration of adrenocorticotropic hormone. Moreover, {CB} 34 increased the plasma concentration of this hormone to a greater extent in isolated rats than in group-housed animals. The persistent decrease in the concentrations of neuroactive steroids induced by social isolation might thus be due to an adaptive decrease in the activity either of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis or of {PBRs} during the prolonged stress, reflecting a defense mechanism to limit glucocorticoid production. The larger increase in neuroactive steroid concentrations induced by {CB} 34 and the enhanced pituitary response to this compound in isolated rats indicate that this mild stressor increases the response of {PBRs.} © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The composition of the food mixtures for the 3 groups was adjusted so that the lower consumption was at the expense of grains only. Energy restrictions inhibited implantation at a high incidence until the 18th day of lactation, when the restriction was lifted. Energy restriction also caused lower delivery rates. This was assumed to be due to unaccomplished implantation after interruption of the blastocystic diapause. The young nursed by the dams subjected to food restriction were retarded. It was suggested that the energy deficit resulting from heavy lactation was responsible for the extended delay in implantation by depressing gonadotrophic function and by increasing suckling intensity in the retarded young.},

	abstract = {Pathological cardiac hypertrophy caused by diverse etiologies eventually leads to cardiac dilation and functional decompensation. We have recently reported that genetic deletion of Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 1 ({ROCK1)} inhibited several pathological events including cardiomyocyte apoptosis in compensated hypertrophic hearts. The present study investigated whether {ROCK1} deficiency can prevent the transition from hypertrophy to heart failure. Transgenic mice with cardiac-restricted overexpression of Goal develop compensated cardiac hypertrophy at young ages, but progress into lethal cardiomyopathy accompanied by increased apoptosis after pregnancy or at old ages. The studies were first carried out using age- and pregnancy-matched wild-type, G alpha g, {ROCK1(-/-)}, and G alpha {q/ROCK1(-/-)} mice. The potent beneficial effect of {ROCK1} deletion is demonstrated by abolishment of peripartum mortality, and significant attenuation of left ventricular ({LV)} dilation, wall thinning, and contractile dysfunction in the peripartum Gaq transgenic mice. Increase in cardiomyocyte apoptosis was suppressed by {ROCK1} deletion, associated with increased extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase ({ERK/MAPK)} activation and inhibition of mitochondrial translocation of Bax. In addition, {ROCK1} deficiency also improved survival, inhibited cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and preserved {LV} dimension and function in old Gaq mice at 12 months. Furthermore, transgenic overexpression of {ROCK1} increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis and accelerated hypertrophic decompensation in Gaq hearts in the absence of pregnancy stress. The present study provides for the first time in vivo evidence for the long-term beneficial effects of {ROCK1} deficiency in hypertrophic decompensation and suggests that {ROCK1} may be an attractive therapeutic target to limit heart failure progression.

Fluorometric measurements revealed that {3alpha5betaS} attenuated and Ca2+ pregnenolone hemisuccinate augmented glutamate-induced increase in intracellular Ca2+. Pregnenolone sulfate slowed the decay of Ca2+ increase induced by glutamate, without significant effect on the peak amplitude of Ca2+ increase.

Once every 3 days (for a total of six injections), half the rats from each nutritional treatment group (repeated exposure) were injected with cocaine (30 mg/kg, l.p.) and their total amount of stereotypy (rearing, forepaw treading, compulsive sniffing and head bobbing) monitored. The remaining rats received five saline injections followed by a cocaine injection on the last injection day (acute exposure group) and their behavioral response was also measured. Despite being slightly less sensitive to cocaine following their first injection, by the sixth injection, prenatally protein malnourished animals in the repeated-exposure group exhibited significantly greater sensitization to the psychomotor stimulant effects of cocaine than well-nourished controls. In the acute exposure groups, however, prenatally malnourished males, but not females, exhibited significantly more stereotypy than well-nourished subjects following a single cocaine injection. These findings have implications for characterizing addiction potential in the previously malnourished rats, as well as providing additional information regarding factors which can influence sensitization.},

Although lactation costs are positively correlated with litter size, the shape of this relationship remains largely unexplored. Understanding physiological efficiencies of metabolic investment in reproduction should provide valuable insight concerning trade-offs between number and size of offspring and limits to litter size. I used data from northern grasshopper mice (Onychomys leucogaster) to explore these constraints. The relationship between litter size and cost of lactation was best described by a non-linear regression such that intermediate litter sizes were the most cost-effective. Lactation costs at the upper range of natural litters for this species required mothers to ingest more than twice as much food as non-reproductive females. Young at 15 d of age from the largest litters were smaller than same-age young from smaller litters. In contrast, young from litters at the lower end of the species range were larger than average. These data suggest that the distribution of litter sizes within this species is selected against at the lower end by inefficient conversion of energy into viable offspring and at the upper end by simple limits on digestive efficiency or capacity.},

Offspring were either adequately nourished during the fetal and suckling periods, undernourished during both, or/and undernourished during one or the other period. All rats were fed ad libitum from weaning. The postnatally underfed animals were the most efficient at running a maze for a food reward. Differences in levels of motivation were sought using a Skinner box in which rats learned to press a lever for food. Normal rats had the lowest lever pressing rate and those restricted both pre- and postnatally had the highest. The tendency to inhibit movement to avoid an electric shock was weakest in normal rats and greatest in the doubly deprived animals. As in the Skinner box test, rats undernourished during only one period occupied intermediate positions. This is taken to indicate that, with respect to these two measures of behavior, the effects of undernutrition in the fetal and suckling periods were additive. Evidence for an aditive effect on physical brain growth is confined to forebrain {DNA} P content, which was substantially reduced by both periods of growth retardation.

Early weaning was inferred by lower rates of milk transfer, an earlier reduction in care-giving activities and increased unwillingness to suckle pups. However, food-restricted and pregnant mothers differed in how they weaned their offspring. Most notably, pregnant dams became highly aggressive to their pups around this time. After weaning was completed, levels of play in both groups of early weaned pups were higher than those of control pups. Thus the discovery of a relationship between early weaning and increased play, previously reported in domestic cats, Felis catus, generalizes to a second altricial species. Since details of the increased play response varied between the litters of food-restricted and pregnant mothers, the former engaging in more social play and locomotor play and the latter only in more locomotor play, this difference was attributed to the nature of the weaning process that rat pups experienced earlier. © 1991.},

	volume = {72},
	abstract = {The purpose of the present report was to investigate the potential interactive relation between perinatal (gestation/lactation) cadmium exposure and changes in responsiveness to cocaine. In Experiment 1, adult female rats were exposed to a diet containing 50 ppm cadmium (as cadmium chloride) or a diet containing no added cadmium for 30 days prior to breeding with nonexposed males. The metal-exposure regimen continued throughout gestation, and for 15 days of lactation, at which time all animals were placed on standard rat chow diets containing no added cadmium for the remainder of the investigation. Atomic absorption assays confirmed that cadmium concentrations were significantly elevated in metal-exposed dams, littermates, and test animals. Offspring were weaned on postnatal day ({PND)} 21 and commenced cocaine sensitization testing on {PND} 70. Testing operations for controls and animals perinatally exposed to cadmium consisted of 21 daily i.p. injections of vehicle (saline) or 10 mg/kg cocaine {HCl}, and subsequent recording of locomotor activity. Subsequently, across successive days, all animals received 0, 10, and 20 mg/kg cocaine challenges. The results showed that cocaine sensitization was attenuated in animals perinatally exposed to cadmium. A similar pattern of antagonism was observed in Experiment 2 where a higher dose of cocaine was required to produce conditioned place preference ({CPP)} in cadmium-exposed animals. The implications of these findings with respect to the interactive role of cadmium in the dynamics of cocaine use/abuse remain unclear. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The effects of oxytocin on fetal and placental growth and on maternal weight gain and accumulation of body fat were studied in ad libitum-fed and food-restricted (receiving 70\% of the food intake of the ad libitum-fed group) pregnant rats. Further, a possible role of the {IGF} axis in mediating oxytocin-induced changes was assessed. Pregnant rats were injected subcutaneously once a day during gestational d 1-5 with saline or oxytocin (1 mg/kg). Ad libitum-fed oxytocin-treated pregnant rats had higher circulating levels of {IGF-I}, larger placentas, fetuses, and newborn pups and contained less body fat at the end of pregnancy. In food-restricted dams, oxytocin- treatment had no effect on fetal and placental growth. Additionally, food restriction attenuated the normal increase in {IGF} binding protein-3 protease proteolysis during pregnancy. The results show that oxytocin may affect maternal adaptations to pregnancy and stimulate fetal growth. We suggest that this effect may be mediated by increased {IGF-I} in ad libitum-fed animals, whereas food restriction may block this effect by resulting in low levels of circulating {IGF-I} and by attenuating the pregnancy-associated increase in {IGF} binding protein-3 protease activity and, thereby, further compromise {IGF} bioavailability.},

Malnutrition was induced by feeding a low protein purified diet to lactating dams thus reducing milk supply for suckling pups, and after weaning at 3 weeks of age a low protein diet was fed for an additional 4 weeks followed by a high protein diet for rehabilitation. This optimal diet was fed to controls throughout the study. Three levels of environmental manipulation, normal, isolated and enriched, were provided to each of the dietary groups during the first 7 weeks of life after which normal conditions of both diet and environment were followed until the study was terminated at 20 weeks of age. Consistent with previous findings, early protein energy malnutrition resulted in long lasting elevation of brain {ChE} activity. In control fed rats, environmental isolation resulted in increases in {ChE} specific activity, whereas, in early malnourished rats, isolation led to lowered {ChE} activity. Environmental enrichment did not affect {ChE} in control fed rats and as a result, {ChE} specific activity of enriched animals was lower than was found in isolated animals. Adrenal {ChE} activity was increased in previously malnourished rats. No further increase was noted due to environmental manipulation, but in control fed rats both enriched and isolated animals had elevated adrenal {ChE} activity.},

	volume = {128},
	abstract = {Prenatal malnutrition results in increased concentration and release of central noradrenaline, a neurotransmitter that is an important regulator of normal regressive events such as axonal pruning and synaptic elimination. This suggests that some of the functional disturbances in brain induced by prenatal malnutrition could be due at least in part to increased noradrenaline activity that may enhance regressive events during early stages of development. To test this hypothesis we studied whether chronic administration of alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, an inhibitor of tyrosine hydroxylase, to rats during gestation might prevent long-term deleterious effects of prenatal malnutrition on functional properties of interhemispheric connections of the visual cortex, and on asymmetry of visual evoked responses. The experiments were conducted on normal and malnourished rats 45-50 d of age. Prenatal malnutrition was induced by restricting the food consumption of pregnant rats to 40\%, from d 8 postconception to parturition. At birth, prenatally malnourished rats had significantly greater whole-brain noradrenaline concentration as well as significantly enhanced noradrenaline release in the visual cortex. At 45-50 d of age, the malnourished group had a significantly smaller cortical area, exhibiting transcallosal evoked responses; in addition, the amplitude of these responses was significantly smaller. Malnourished rats showed a significant reduction of the normal interhemispheric asymmetry of visual evoked responses. The addition of 0.3\% alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine to the diet of malnourished pregnant rats during the last 2 wk of gestation prevented functional disorders induced in the offspring by prenatal malnutrition on interhemispheric connectivity of visual areas and on interhemispheric bioelectrical asymmetry, probably by reducing the elevated brain noradrenaline activity and thereby restoring the normal trophic role of this neurotransmitter.},

	volume = {175},
	abstract = {Several lines of evidence indicate that animals in the wild may be limited in their maximal rates of energy intake by their intrinsic physiology rather than food availability. Understanding the limits to sustained energy intake is important because this defines an envelope within which animals must trade-off competing activities. In the first part of this review, we consider the initial ideas that propelled this area and experimental evidence connected with them. An early conceptual advance in this field was the idea that energy intake could be centrally limited by aspects of the digestive process, or peripherally limited at the sites of energy utilisation. A model system that has been widely employed to explore these ideas is lactation in small rodents. Initial studies in the late 1980s indicated that energy intake might be centrally limited, but work by Hammond and colleagues in the 1990s suggested that it was more likely that the limits were imposed by capacity of the mammary glands, and other works tended to support this view. This consensus, however, was undermined by studies that showed milk production was higher in mice at low temperatures, suggesting that the capacity of the mammary gland is not a limiting factor. In the second part of the review we consider some additional hypotheses that might explain these conflicting data. These include the heat dissipation limits hypothesis, the seasonal investment hypothesis and the saturated neural control hypothesis. Current evidence with respect to these hypotheses is also reviewed. The limited evidence presently available does not unambiguously support any one of them. © Springer-Verlag 2005.},

Fetal demise and growth restrictions were produced after intraperitoneal injection of ethanol to pregnant mice during midgestation (E8). Death and growth abnormalities elicited by alcohol treatment during development are believed to be associated, in part, with severe oxidative damage. {NAP} and {ADNF-9} have been shown to exhibit antioxidative and antiapoptotic actions in vitro. Pretreatment with an equimolar combination of the peptides prevented the alcohol-induced fetal death and growth abnormalities. Pretreatment with {NAP} alone resulted in a significant decrease in alcohol-associated fetal death; whereas {ADNF-9} alone had no detectable effect on fetal survival after alcohol exposure, indicating a pharmacological distinction between the peptides. Biochemical assessment of the fetuses indicated that the combination peptide treatment prevented the alcohol-induced decreases in reduced glutathione. Peptide efficacy was evident with either 30-min pretreatment or with 1-h post-alcohol administration. Bioavailability studies with [ {3H]NAPVSIPQ} indicated that 39\% of the total radioactivity comigrated with intact peptide in the fetus 60 min after administration. These studies demonstrate that fetal death and growth restriction associated with prenatal alcohol exposure were prevented by combinatorial peptide treatment and suggest that this therapeutic strategy be explored in other models/diseases associated with oxidative stress.},

	abstract = {Maternal diabetes is a common complication of pregnancy, and the offspring of diabetic mothers have a higher risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life. Despite these observations, the precise biological processes mediating this metabolic programming are not well understood. Here, we explored the consequences of maternal diabetes on the organization of hypothalamic neural circuits involved in the regulation of energy balance. To accomplish this aim, we used a mouse model of maternal insulin deficiency induced by streptozotocin injections. Maternal diabetes was found to be associated with changes in offspring growth as revealed by a significantly higher pre- and postweaning body weight in the offspring of insulin-deficient dams relative to those of control mice. Mice born to diabetic dams also showed increased fasting glucose levels, increased insulin levels, and increased food intake during their adult lives. These impairments in metabolic regulation were associated with leptin resistance during adulthood. Importantly, the ability of leptin to activate intracellular signaling in arcuate neurons was also significantly reduced in neonates born to diabetic dams. Furthermore, neural projections from the arcuate nucleus to the paraventricular nucleus were markedly reduced in the offspring of insulin-deficient dams. Together, these data show that insulin deficiency during gestation has long-term consequences for metabolic regulation. They also indicate that animals born to diabetic dams display abnormally organized hypothalamic feeding pathways that could result from the attenuated responsiveness of hypothalamic neurons to the neurotrophic actions of leptin during neonatal development.

We studied whether transient inhibition of {NMDA} receptor activity during early postnatal development would produce a behavioral phenotype resembling that of individuals who are susceptible to develop schizophrenia. Methods: Rat pups were given injections of the {NMDA} channel blocker {MK801} on postnatal days 7 through 10. This period is akin to the prenatal second trimester of primate development. Cognitive function was tested in adulthood. Results: Treatment with {MK801} impaired cognitive flexibility and working memory. The impairment in cognitive flexibility was due to increased perseverative behavior. Treatment did not affect locomotor activity or recognition memory. Conclusions. These results suggest that a brief disruption of {NMDA} receptors during a sensitive period of cortical development is sufficient to produce selective cognitive deficits that are relevant to schizophrenia.},

Determinations were made immediately following killing (0 min, or postisolation) as well as after a period in glucose-free medium, (60 min or postincubation) with or without additions. The postisolation levels of triglycerides (0 min) in the uterus from normal-fed estrous animals were lower than in diestrus but in each group did not differ in comparison with postincubation values (60 min), either without additions or in the presence of indomethacin (10-{6M).} Initial (0 min) tissue triglycerides of estrous and diestrous partially-starved rats were significantly higher than in their respective fed controls and exhibited different modifications depending on the stage of the sex cycle. In estrus,levels remained unaltered at the end of an incubating period without additions and declined in the presence of indomethacin. This influence of indomethacin was not modified by added {PGF2α} (10-{9M)} but was effectively abolished by {PGE2} (10-{9M).} On the contrary, in diestrus, initial triglyceride levels diminished spontaneously following 60 min without additions, this being antagonized by indomethacin or propranolol (10-{6M).} Furthermore, exogenous {PGE2} failed to alter the effect of indomethacin whereas {PGE2α} evoked its abolition. Propranolol, which effectively blocked the spontaneous decrement of triglycerides as did indomethacin,prevented also the influence of {PGF2α} on the action of indomethecin. The foregoing results are compatible with the notion that the regulation of triglycerides in rat uteri suspended in the absence of axogenous substrate, is affected differently by prostaglandin E2 and F2α depending on the state of the sex cycle. They also suggested that the phenomenon may involve the activation of the beta adrenoreceptors. © 1984.},

	abstract = {The mammalian master clock driving circadian rhythmicity in physiology and behavior resides within the suprachiasmatic nuclei ({SCN)} of the hypothalamus. {SCN} neurons contain a molecular oscillator composed of a set of clock genes that acts in intertwined negative and positive feedback loops [1]. In addition, all peripheral tissues analyzed thus far have been shown to contain circadian oscillators [2]. This raises the question of whether the central circadian pacemaker in the {SCN} is sufficient to evoke behavioral rhythms or whether peripheral circadian clockworks are also required. Mice with a mutated {CLOCK} protein (a transcriptional activator of E box-containing clock and clock output genes) or lacking both {CRYPTOCHROMES}, {mCRY1} and {mCRY2} proteins (inhibitors of E box-mediated transcription), lack circadian rhythmicity in behavior [3, 4]. Here, we show that transplantation of mouse fetal {SCN} tissue into the hypothalamus restores free-running circadian behavioral rhythmicity in Clock mutant or {mCfy1/mCry2} double knockout mice. The periodicity of the emerged rhythms is determined by the genetic constitution (i.e., wild-type or {mCry2} knockout) of the grafted {SCN.} Since transplanted {mCfy1/mCry2-deficient} mice do not have functional circadian oscillators [5] other than those present in the grafted hypothalamus region, these findings suggest that the {SCN} can generate circadian behavioral rhythms in the absence of distant peripheral oscillators in the brain or elsewhere.},

Subcutaneous Zn treatment with ethanol in early pregnancy has been shown to prevent birth abnormalities and memory impairments in mice. This study examined whether dietary Zn supplementation throughout pregnancy can prevent cognitive impairments caused by early ethanol exposure. Pregnant {C57BL/6J} mice were fed either a control (35 μg Zn/g) or Zn-supplemented (200 μg Zn/g) diet throughout pregnancy. On gestational day ({GD)} 8, mice received two intraperitoneal injections (4 h apart) of either saline or 25\% ethanol (0.015 {mL/g).} All offspring were screened for physical and behavioural defects (e.g. growth, visual, exploratory, anxiety, motor deficits). Twenty-four phenotypically-normal offspring were randomly selected from each of the four treatment groups (saline ± Zn-supplementation, ethanol ± Zn-supplementation) and tested at 60 d of age using a cross-maze escape task for spatial learning and memory impairments, and an object recognition task. While no differences were observed between treatments for spatial learning, offspring exposed to ethanol demonstrated spatial memory impairments at both 12 and 28 d after learning an escape task, with less correct trials and increased escape latency scores compared with saline-treated mice. Furthermore, these mice also exhibited impairments in object recognition memory. In comparison, ethanol-exposed offspring from dams fed a Zn-supplemented diet throughout pregnancy did not display spatial memory or object recognition deficits, performing at the same level as saline-treated offspring. Therefore, dietary Zn-supplementation during pregnancy prevents spatial and object recognition memory impairments caused by ethanol exposure during early pregnancy. © 2007 Elsevier {B.V.} All rights reserved.},

To explore in greater detail the physiological roles of {FII} in vivo, {FII-deficient} ({FII(-/-))} mice were generated. Inactivation of the {FII} gene leads to partial embryonic lethality with more than one-half of the {FII(-/)-} embryos dying between embryonic days 9.5 and 11.5. Bleeding into the yolk sac cavity and varying degrees of tissue necrosis were observed in many {FII(-/-)} embryos within this gestational time frame.

	abstract = {We have previously proposed that uterine caspase-3 may modulate uterine contractility in a gestationally regulated fashion. The objective of this study was to determine the mechanism by which uterine caspase-3 is activated and consequently controlled in the pregnant uterus across gestation. Utilizing the mouse uterus as our gestational model we examined the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathways and the endoplasmic reticulum stress response as potential activators of uterine caspase-3 at the transcriptional and translational level. Our study revealed robust activation of the uterine myocyte endoplasmic reticulum stress response and its adaptive unfolded protein response during pregnancy coinciding respectively with increased uterine caspase-3 activity and its withdrawal to term. In contrast the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathways remained inactive across gestation. We speculate that physiological stimuli experienced by the pregnant uterus likely potentiates the uterine myocyte endoplasmic reticulum stress response resulting in elevated caspase-3 activation, which is isolated to the pregnant mouse myometrium. However as term approaches, activation of an elevated adaptive unfolded protein response acts to limit the endoplasmic reticulum stress response inhibiting caspase-3 resulting in its decline towards term. We speculate that these events have the capacity to regulate gestational length in a caspase-3 dependent manner. © 2013 Suresh et al.},

	volume = {104},
	abstract = {Mammalian imprinted genes are generally thought to have evolved as a result of conflict between parents; however, recent knockout studies suggest that coadaptation between mother and offspring may have been a significant factor. We present evidence that the same imprinted gene that regulates mammalian maternal care and offspring development also regulates male sexual behavior and olfaction. We have shown that the behavior of male mice carrying a knockout of the imprinted gene Peg3 does not change with sexual experience and that the mice are consequently unable to improve their copulatory abilities or olfactory interest in female odor cues after mating experience. Forebrain activation, as indexed by female odor-induced c-Fos protein induction, fails to increase with sexual experience, providing a neural basis for the behavioral deficits that the male mice display. The behavioral and neural effects of the Peg3 knockout show that this imprinted gene has evolved to regulate multiple and varied aspects of reproduction, from male sexual behavior to female maternal care, and the development of offspring. Moreover, sexual experience-driven behavioral changes may represent an adaptive response that enables males to increase their reproductive potential over their lifespan, and the effects we have found suggest that the evolution of genomic imprinting has been influenced by coadaptation between males and females as well as between females and offspring. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the {USA.}},

We found deterioration of body weight gain after postnatal day 8 (P8) in the homozygous mice, as well as a longer latency time to complete the righting reflex and the negative geotaxis tests after P8. Additionally, the homozygous rolling mice exhibited lower pulling and holding attempts after P8 in the hind-limb suspension test. The mice heterozygous and homozygous for the rolling mutation exhibited muscle fatigue after P10 and P8, respectively, following movement execution tests administered immediately after the first trial, suggesting that gene dosage plays an important role in determining when muscle weakness occurs. The homozygous rolling mice showed hind-limb clasping or touching after P14 during the hind-limb and tail suspension tests.

In the present study, younger rats exposed to impoverished environmental conditions and manifesting hippocampal-dependent memory impairments similar to those observed in the aging rodents were given {CDP-choline}, and its effects on this cognitive deficit were assessed. Male Sprague-Dawley rats reared for 3 mo in impoverished ({IC)} or enriched environmental ({EC)} conditions concurrently received either a control diet or a diet supplemented with {CDP-choline} (∼500 mg/kg/d). After 3 mo, rats were trained to perform spatial and cued versions of the Morris water maze, and their rates of acquisition and retention were compared. Impoverished rats exhibited a selective deficit in hippocampal-dependent spatial memory which could be ameliorated by feeding them {CDP-choline.} The {CDP-choline} had no memory-enhancing effect in enriched rats, nor did it prevent the memory impairment of impoverished rats if the animals consumed it for the initial or final months instead of for the entire 3-mo period. These findings indicate that long-term dietary {CDP-choline} supplementation can ameliorate the hippocampal-dependent memory impairment caused by impoverished environmental conditions in rats, and suggest that its actions result, in part, from a long-term effect such as enhanced membrane phosphatide synthesis, an effect shown to require long-term dietary supplementation with {CDP-choline.}},

Solitary subterranean mammals perform these activities in a particularly challenging niche, necessitating energetically expensive burrowing to both search for mates and forage for food. This restriction presumably affects males more than females as the former are thought to dig longer tunnels that cover greater distances to search for females. We excavated burrow systems of male and female Cape dune mole rats Bathyergus suillus the, largest truly subterranean mammal, to investigate whether male burrows differ from those of females in ways that reflect mate searching by males. We consider burrow architecture (length, internal dimensions, fractal dimension of tunnel systems, number of nesting chambers and mole mounds on the surface) in relation to mating strategy. Males excavated significantly longer burrow systems with higher fractal dimensions and larger burrow areas than females. Male burrow systems were also significantly farther from one another than females were from other females' burrow systems. However, no sex differences were evident in tunnel cross-sectional area, mass of soil excavated per mound, number of mounds produced per unit burrow length or mass of soil excavated per burrow system. Hence, while males may use their habitat differently from females, they do not appear to differ in the dimensions of the tunnels they create. Thus, exploration and use of the habitat differs between the sexes, which may be a consequence of sex differences in mating behaviour and greater demands for food.},

	abstract = {Prenatal alcohol exposure can disrupt brain development and lead to a myriad of behavioral alterations, including motor coordination deficits, hyperactivity, and learning deficits. There remains a need, however, to identify treatments and interventions for reducing the severity of alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders. Some of the alcohol-induced deficits in learning may be related to alterations in cholinergic functioning. Interestingly, there is a growing literature demonstrating that pre- and/or early postnatal choline supplementation can lead to long-term enhancement in learning and memory and cholinergic activity in rats. The present study examined whether such early choline supplementation might counter the effects of prenatal alcohol treatment on a visuospatial discrimination task. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to one of three prenatal treatment groups. One group received a liquid diet containing 35\% ethanol-derived calories ({EDC)} from gestational day ({GD)} 6-20. A second group served as a pair-fed ({PF)} control group and the third group served as an ad lib lab chow ({LC)} control. On postnatal day ({PD)} 2, pups were assigned within-litter to one of three postnatal treatments: choline, saline vehicle, or no treatment. Choline and vehicle pups were intubated with a choline chloride solution or vehicle daily from {PD} 2 to 21, whereas the non-treated pups were handled daily but not intubated. On {PD} 45, subjects were tested on a visuospatial discrimination task. Ethanol-exposed subjects who were not treated neonatally with choline committed a significantly greater number of errors both during acquisition and during delayed discrimination training compared to both {PF} and {LC} controls. Neonatal choline treatment significantly improved performance on the discrimination task in all groups; however, the beneficial effects of choline were significantly larger in ethanol-exposed subjects. Indeed, the performance of ethanol-exposed pups treated with neonatal choline did not differ from any of the {PF} or {LC} groups on any measure. Thus, early postnatal choline supplementation significantly attenuated the effects of prenatal alcohol on this learning task. Importantly, these effects were not due to the acute effects of choline, but rather to longterm changes in brain and behavioral development. These data suggest that early dietary interventions may reduce the severity of fetal alcohol effects. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Prenatal alcohol exposure can disrupt brain development, leading to a variety of behavioral alterations including learning deficits, hyperactivity, and motor dysfunction. We have been investigating the possibility that perinatal choline supplementation may effectively reduce the severity of alcohol's adverse effects on behavioral development. We previously reported that perinatal choline supplementation can ameliorate alcohol-induced learning deficits and hyperactivity in rats exposed to alcohol during development. The present study examined whether perinatal choline supplementation could also reduce the severity of motor deficits induced by alcohol exposure during the third trimester equivalent brain growth spurt. Male neonatal rats were assigned to one of three treatment groups. One group was exposed to alcohol (6.6 g/kg/day) from postnatal days ({PD)} 4 to 9 via an artificial rearing procedure. Artificially and normally reared control groups were included. One half of subjects from each treatment received daily subcutaneous injections of a choline chloride solution from {PD} 4 to 30, whereas the other half received saline vehicle injections. On {PD} 35-37, subjects were tested on a parallel bar motor task, which requires both balance and fine motor coordination. Ethanol-exposed subjects exhibited significant motor impairments compared to both control groups whose performance did not differ significantly from one another. Perinatal choline treatment did not affect motor performance in either ethanol or control subjects. These data indicate that the beneficial effects of perinatal choline supplementation in ethanol-treated subjects are task specific and suggest that choline is more effective in mitigating cognitive deficits compared to motor deficits associated with developmental alcohol exposure. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Prenatal dietary sodium restriction produces profound developmental effects on rat functional taste responses and formation of neural circuits in the brainstem. Converging evidence indicates that the underlying mechanisms for these effects are related to a compromised nutritional state and not to direct stimulus-receptor interactions. We explored whether early malnourishment produces similar functional and structural effects to those seen following dietary sodium restriction by using a protein deficient, sodium replete diet. To determine if early dietary protein-restriction affects the development of the peripheral gustatory system, multi-fiber neurophysiological recordings were made from the chorda tympani nerve and anterograde track tracing of the chorda tympani nerve into the nucleus of the solitary tract ({NTS)} was accomplished in rats fed a protein-restricted or a control diet (6\% and 20\%, respectively). The dietary regimens began on embryonic day 7 and continued until rats were used for neurophysiological recordings (postnatal days (P) 35-50) or for chorda tympani terminal field labeling (P40-50). Responses to a concentration series of {NaCl}, sodium acetate, {KCl}, and to 0.50 M sucrose, 0.03 M quinine-{HCl}, and 0.01 N {HCl} revealed attenuated responses (30-60\%) to sodium-specific stimuli in rats fed the 6\% protein diet compared with those fed the 20\% protein diet. Responses to all other stimuli were similar between groups. Terminal field volumes were nearly twofold larger in protein-restricted rats compared with controls, with the differences located primarily in the dorsal-caudal zone of the terminal field. These results are similar to the results seen previously in rats fed a sodium-restricted diet throughout pre- and postnatal development, suggesting that dietary sodium- and protein-restriction share similar mechanisms in altering gustatory development.

	abstract = {Studies of the metabolic and physiological changes that bears undergo during hibernation have, for the most part, supported the paradigm that bears use only fatty tissues as a metabolic substrate during hibernation. This study was performed to document the extent of protein loss and alteration of muscle-fiber characteristics of selected muscles in black bears during winter dormancy. Muscle biopsies were removed from the gas trocnemius and biceps femoris from seven free-ranging female black bears on the Uncompahgre Plateau in west-central Colorado. Six of the seven bears produced cubs during the hibernating season. Muscle samples were collected from the left hind limb shortly after bears entered their dens (fall), and additional samples were collected from the right hind limb just prior to bears leaving their dens (spring). Protein concentration, fast- and slow-twitch muscle-fiber ratios and muscle-fiber cross-sectional areas, and citrate synthase activity were measured in the laboratory. While protein concentration decreased in both muscles during the hibernation period, it was lower than predicted for lactating females. In addition, muscle-fiber number and cross-sectional area were unchanged in these muscles, suggesting only limited muscle atrophy. In support of these observations, there was a moderate but significant increase in the proportion of fast-twitch fibers only in the biceps femoris, with a concomitant decrease in citrate synthase activity, but no alteration of the fiber ratio in the gastrocnemius during hibernation. These findings suggest that hibernating bears, particularly lactating females, do use some protein, in concert with fat catabolism, as a metabolic substrate and as a source of water. However, the extent of this protein use is moderate and is associated with limited alteration of muscle structure, characteristic of disuse atrophy.},

Prior exposure to an acute stressful episode does however seem to enhance the capacity of the hippocampus to exhibit {LTD} in vivo in male animals. In the present experiments, we examined the capacity for low-frequency stimuli (low-frequency stimulation ({LFS))} to induce {LTD} in juvenile male and female animals following an acute stress episode. Interestingly, prior exposure to stress was only required for the induction of {LTD} in male animals, while both control and stressed female animals exhibited equivalent {LTD.} In animals that were exposed to ethanol in utero, a similar requirement for prior exposure to stress to elicit {LTD} was found for male, but not female animals. This prenatal ethanol exposure did not in itself alter the capacity for {LTD} induction in either sex; however, in utero food restriction did enhance {LTD} induction in both male and female animals, irrespective of whether they were exposed to stress just prior to being administered {LFS.} These results indicate that in utero dietary restriction more drastically affects {CA1} {LTD} than in utero ethanol exposure. In addition, female animals seem to exhibit {LTD} in vivo in the absence of stress much more easily than their male counterparts. (c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

In Experiment 1, a rewarded alternation task, run as a spatial working memory procedure on an elevated T-maze, revealed no differences between the formerly malnourished (6/25) and control (25/25) rats when either a minimal or a 20-s inter-trial delay was used. Neither was there a difference when an additional, and conflicting, 'information' run was given to provide a source of proactive interference. In extinction, the 6/25 rats required significantly more sessions to abolish their learned alternation response than the controls. In Experiment 2, an operant equivalent of the T-maze task was applied which allowed greater control over the delay interval and task difficulty. Each trial consisted of a forced information response, for which a randomly selected lever was presented, followed by a free-choice stage, when both levers were presented. The rats were rewarded for pressing the lever not presented at the information stage. The inter-trial interval was always 30 s. When the information response requirement was 10 presses no group differences were found in acquisition of the alternation response or in task performance at delays of 5, 10, 15 or 30 s between information and choice stages. As task difficulty was increased, the performance of the 6/25 rats improved more than that of the 25/25 rats, such that they performed significantly better at the longest delay when the information response requirement was 2 presses. This superior performance of the experimental animals is discussed. No differences in reversal were detected. It was concluded that there is no straight-forward 'hippocampal syndrome' in prenatally malnourished adult rats. Working memory appears largely unaffected, whereas susceptibility to interference and extinction may be modified, depending upon the test parameters employed.},

At postnatal day 90, rats were tested during acquisition of the submerged platform version of the Morris water maze task using four systemic doses of muscimol (0.1, 0.3, 1.0 and 1.8 mg/kg i.p.) or three systemic doses of {CL218},872 (1.0, 3.2, and 5.6 mg/kg i.p.). In a dose dependent manner both drugs impaired acquisition of the task and impaired accuracy of the search pattern on the probe trial (platform removed). However, neither drug dissociated the performance of the two nutritional groups. These data are important in light of previous findings of differential behavioral effects of the non-specific {BZ} agonist, chlordiazepoxide ({CDP)}, on spatial learning and on drug discrimination in prenatally malnourished rats and in the context of previous findings of reduced sensitivity to the anxiolytic effects of non-specific {BZ} receptor agonists across a wide variety of models of malnutrition. The present findings also support the concept that prenatal malnutrition does not affect the global functioning of the {GABA(A)} receptor, but fundamentally alters the way in which a subset of {GABA(A)} receptors (i.e. those containing the alpha2, alpha3 and/or the alpha5 but not the alpha1 subunit) is modulated by {BZs.}},

Rats were tested during acquisition of the submerged platform version of the Morris water maze task using three systemic doses of {CDP} (3.2, 5.6, and 7.5 mg/kg {IF)} at two ages (day 30 and day 90). At 30 days, prenatally malnourished rats showed less sensitivity to the amnestic effect of the 5.6-mg/kg dose when compared with well-nourished controls by displaying shorter swim paths during acquisition and a more selective search of the target quadrant upon removal of the platform (probe trial). At 90 days, prenatally malnourished rats again showed less sensitivity to {CDP} at a dose of 5.6 mg/kg, but more sensitivity to the 3.2-mg/kg dose (indicated on the probe trial). No obvious relationship was identified between the nutritional group differences in behavioral sensitivity to {CDP} at 90 days and their {BZ} receptor density in the hippocampus or medial septum. It can be concluded that prenatal malnutrition alters the amnestic response to {CDP} in a dose-dependent and developmentally specific manner, thus providing further support for functional changes within the {GABAergic} system subsequent to malnutrition.

Sprague-Dawley dams were fed a low-protein (6\% casein), adequate protein (25\% casein), or a laboratory chow diet prior to mating and throughout pregnancy. Within each diet group, rats received either cocaine injections (30 mg/kg {IP} two times per week prior to mating and then 30 mg/kg {SC} daily from day 3 to 18 of pregnancy) or saline injections. All litters were fostered on the day of birth to saline-injected mothers fed either the 25\% casein diet or the chow diet. Gestation length was decreased by prenatal cocaine exposure whereas litter size was reduced by prenatal malnutrition. On postnatal days 21, 25, 30, or 70, rats were tested for their ability to locate a submerged platform in a Morris water maze. In well-nourished rats, prenatal cocaine increased the mean distance swum during acquisition over days 21-30, a difference that was abolished in rats with prenatal malnutrition. Ln the absence of drug exposure (saline groups), prenatal malnutrition was itself associated with longer swim paths. Neither prenatal insult affected the accuracy of the spatial navigation at these ages, as determined by their search pattern when the platform was removed. On postnatal day 25, rats raised on the chow diet exhibited superior performance to that of rats raised on the 25\% casein diet, but by day 30 these two well-nourished groups were comparable. At day 70, prenatal cocaine impaired spatial performance on the first session, in well-nourished rats only. Thus, these results provide no support for the hypothesis that prenatal cocaine and protein malnutrition combine to produce a greater effect on behavioral development than either insult alone.

In the control group, females with a history of prenatal malnutrition made significantly fewer entries into the center of the arena than did well-nourished females, suggesting that baseline differences in anxiety exist between the two nutritional groups of females. In addition to open field, the experimental group of animals was also tested in a forced swim test conducted at the beginning (Day 5) and at the end of the stress regimen (Day 15). Significant differences were observed between nutritional groups on Day 15 only: prenatally malnourished males exhibited a lower latency to immobility than well-nourished males, whereas the opposite effect was found in malnourished females. In Experiment 2, separate groups of males were exposed to forced swim on two different occasions without the stress regimen between exposures. A somewhat different pattern of findings was generated. There was no significant difference in the latency to immobility between malnourished and well-nourished rats on the second forced swim. However, malnourished animals showed greater total immobility than the well-nourished controls in the second exposure to forced swim, providing further support for the interpretation that the malnourished males were less affected than well- nourished ones, or adapted more readily to the stress regimen in Experiment 1. Overall these results suggest that the relationship between prenatal malnutrition and stress depends on the level of stress (acute vs. chronic), the type of behavioral measure used to assess its effects, as well as gender.},

	abstract = {We investigated metabolizable energy intake ({MEI)} and milk energy output in European hares throughout gestation and lactation in females raising three young, i.e., close to maximum litter size in this precocial species. We hypothesized that herbivorous hares may face a central limitation of energy turnover during lactation, imposed by maximum capacity of the gastrointestinal tract. Females were provided with low-energy or high-energy diets, either continually, or during lactation only. Unexpectedly, females on either diet reached identical peak {MEIs} ({\textgreater} 6 times {BMR)} during late lactation, with females on low-energy diet increasing food intake proportionally. Thus, we reject our hypothesis that in lactating hares, peak {MEI} is centrally limited. During early lactation, {MEI} and milk transfer was, however, significantly impaired in females on the low-energy diet, indicating a temporal central limitation due to a time-lag caused by the readjustment of energy intake capacity. Importantly, irrespective of the diet, females significantly increased peak {MEI} late in the breeding season. Consequently, earlier in the season, when energy reserves are still high, energy throughput was not limited by physiological constraints at all.

	abstract = {The objetive of the present study was to investigate the effects of prenatal and postnatal nutrition, and the postnatal exposure of toluene vapors over open field performance in wistar rats. Material and methods: nulliparous wistar female rats were nourished by restricting food to 50\% of ad libitum intake compared to that consumed by well nourished rats, three weeks before they were mated and kept on this diet during gestation, and lactation. The offspring following were malnourished by the same method until 60 days postnatally. Toluene inhalating and by the offspring was carried out at 40 to 60 days postnatally. The daily toluene dose used was 0.4 ml placed in a 3.7 L crystal chamber for 15 minutes. Six groups were constituted with 10-14 animals: three groups well nourished, were kept under controlled laboratory conditions (N), exposed to toluene vapors ({NT)}, or as a handling control ({CM);} and three undernourished, were kept under controlled laboratory conditions (D), exposed to toluene vapors ({DT)}, or as a handling control ({DM).} All animals were submitted to an open-field performance test during which they were filmed for 5 minutes moving in a 100 × 100 × 45 cm box. The total distance covered was estimated by reviewing the videotape. Results, the weight and distance were analyzed using Bonferroni, feces fecals U de Mann-Witney and to sprucing up with {ANOVA.} Conclusions, these indicated assotiation of the malnutrition and toluene inhalation exposure significantly reduced the rats body weight. In response to the exposure to a new environment, nourished groups rats, that were introduced in the inhalation chamber without solvent ({NM} and {DM)}, showed greater activity in the open field than the other groups.},

In the present study, behavioural effects of perinatal and chronic hypothyroidism were assessed during development in both male and female offspring of hypothyroid rats. To induce hypothyroidism, dams and offspring were fed an iodide-poor diet and drinking water with 0.75\% sodium perchlorate; dams starting 2 weeks prior to mating and pups either until the day of killing (chronic hypothyroidism) or only until weaning (perinatal hypothyroidism) to test for reversibility of the effects observed. Neuromotor competence, locomotor activity and cognitive function were monitored in the offspring until postnatal day 71 and were compared with age-matched control rats. Early neuromotor competence, as assessed in the grip test and balance beam test, was impaired by both chronic and perinatal hypothyroidism. The open field test, assessing locomotor activity, revealed hyperactive locomotor behavioural patterns in chronic hypothyroid animals only. The Morris water maze test, used to assess cognitive performance, showed that chronic hypothyroidism affected spatial memory in a negative manner. In contrast, perinatal hypothyroidism was found to impair spatial memory in female rats only. In general, the effects of chronic hypothyroidism on development were more pronounced than the effects of perinatal hypothyroidism, suggesting the early effects of hypothyroidism on functional alterations of the developing brain to be partly reversible and to depend on developmental timing of the deficiency.},

	volume = {9},
	abstract = {{Serotonin1A} receptor (5-{HT1AR)} deficiency has been associated with anxiety and depression and mice with genetic receptor inactivation exhibit heightened anxiety. We have reported that 5-{HT1AR} is not only a genetic but also a maternal 'environmental' factor in the development of anxiety in Swiss-Webster mice. Here, we tested whether the emergence of maternal genotype-dependent adult anxiety is preceded by early behavioral abnormalities or whether it is manifested following a normal emotional development. Pups born to null or heterozygote mothers had significantly reduced ultrasonic vocalization ({USV)} between postnatal day (P) 4 and 12, indicating an influence of the maternal genotype. The offspring's own genotype had an effect limited to P4. Furthermore, we observed reduced weight gain in the null offspring of null but not heterozygote mothers, indicating that a complete maternal receptor deficiency compromises physical development of the offspring. Except a short perinatal deficit during the dark period, heterozygote females displayed normal maternal behavior, which, with the early appearance of {USV} deficit, suggests a role for 5-{HT1AR} during pre-/perinatal development. Consistent with this notion, adult anxiety in the offspring is determined during the pre-/perinatal period. In contrast to heterozygote females, null mothers exhibited impaired pup retrieval and nest building that may explain the reduced weight gain of their offspring. Taken together, our data indicate an important role for the maternal 5-{HT1AR} in regulating emotional and physical development of their offspring. Because reduced receptor binding has been reported in depression, including postpartum depression, reduced 5-{HT1AR} function in mothers may influence the emotional development of their offspring. © 2010 The Authors.

In the present study, we investigated the influence of the maternal {eNOS} genotype on offspring's blood pressure, heart rate, and locomotor activity. The effect of maternal {eNOS} genotype was made by comparing telemetered blood pressure and activity between 2 groups of 13-to 16-week-old male heterozygous {eNOS} knockout mice, 1 produced by a cross of {eNOS} knockout ({eNOS(-/-))} mothers and wild-type ({eNOS(+/+))} fathers ({eNOS(+/-)} {MAT} offspring, N=11), the other by a cross of {eNOS(+/+)} mothers and {eNOS(-/-)} fathers ({eNOS(+/-PAT)} offspring, N=10). Data were also collected for homozygous {eNOS(-/-)} and {eNOS(+/+)} mice (N=15 each). Heterozygous {eNOS} knockout mice exhibited blood pressures that were intermediate to the {eNOS(+/+)} and {eNOS(-/-)} groups. Relative to {eNOS(+/-PAT)} mice, {eNOS(+/-MAT)} mice exhibited significant increases in nocturnal diastolic arterial pressure and diurnal variations (dark-light difference) in systolic, mean, and diastolic arterial pressure. In addition, indices of spontaneous nocturnal locomotor activity, including both the proportion of time spent active and the intensity of activity when active, were also significantly increased. Heart rate did not differ between the groups. Our results suggest that the maternal {eNOS} genotype influences both blood pressure and behavior of offspring, possibly as a consequence of developmental programming associated with intrauterine growth retardation.},

Concentration-response curves were obtained for phosphodiesterase and guanylate cyclase inhibitors, membrane-permeable cyclic nucleotide analogs, and forskolin. In addition, the effects of minimal inhibitory concentrations of these agents on the concentration-response relationships for diethylamine nitric oxide (a nitric oxide donor) were studied. {RESULTS:} Nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitors induced more inhibition of contractions of uterine rings from pregnant rats at term than at midgestation and zaprinast induced less. Inhibitors of guanylate cyclase and membrane-permeable analogs of cyclic guanosine monophosphate were equally effective in tissues from pregnant rats at midgestation and term. All agents attenuated the inhibitory effect of diethylamine nitric oxide at midgestation; however, dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate and papaverine increased the inhibitory effect of diethylamine nitric oxide in tissues from pregnant animals at term. {CONCLUSIONS:} Cyclic nucleotides modulate both spontaneous and nitric oxide-induced changes in uterine contraction during pregnancy. Application of nonselective inhibitors of phosphodiesterase, as well as membrane-permeable analogs of cyclic adenosine monophosphate, may counteract refractoriness to nitric oxide at term.},

Iodine deficiency of the mother can result in an impaired development of the fetal brain. In large areas of the world iodine intake is moderately low. To study the effects of marginal iodine deficiency ({MID)} on the production, distribution, and transport of thyroxine (T-4) and 3,5,3'-tri-iodothyronine (T-3) in nonpregnant and near-term pregnant rats we performed kinetic experiments (three-compartment analysis). Despite unchanged plasma T-4 and T-3 during {MID}, the production and plasma clearance rates of T-4 decreased 30\% (P = 0.01) in {MID} nonpregnant ({MID-C)} rats. For T-3, the plasma clearance rate was increased 70\% (P = 0.046), while the T-3 production was more than doubled (P = 0.042) in {MID-C} rats. In {MID} near-term pregnant rats T-3 production was decreased 20\% (P = 0.04), Hepatic deiodinase type I activity increased during {MID} in both nonpregnant and pregnant rats. It appears that during {MID}, rats are able to maintain their euthyroid status, The pronounced increase in transport of T-4 from plasma to the fast pool observed in pregnant rats on a normal iodine diet did not occur during {MID}, In conclusion in rats {MID} affects maternal thyroid hormone metabolism, thus influencing the availability of maternal T-4 for the fetus.},

Pregnant Long-Evans rats were fed liquid diets containing either 35\% or 0\% ethanol-derived calories during day 6 through day 20 of gestation. These liquid diets were isocaloric and a pair-feeding procedure was employed. The offspring were tested on shuttle avoidance technques at 90 days of age; at 105 days of age all animals were subjected to the deoxyglucose procedures. Prenatal alcohol exposure resulted in a deficit in shuttle avoidance and yielded chronic effects on brain metabolism. Significant decreases in glucose utilization were seen in many structures within sensory, motor, and limbic systems. Significant increases in glucose consumption were found in the hypothalamic-neurohypophysial axis. In summary long-term behavioral and brain metabolic alterations were seen in rats exposed prenatally to alcohol.},

To determine whether this {LTM} deficit is attributable to the reduced {pCREB} level, rats were bilaterally cannulated to deliver Sp-adenosine 3', 5'-cyclic monophosphothioate (Sp-{cAMPS)}, an activator of {PKA.} Infusion of Sp-Adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphothioate Sp-{cAMPS} to {CA1} region increased hippocampal {pCREB} levels and restored normal {LTM} of avoidance learning in rats exposed to novelty. Moreover, a 5 min exposure to the open field 10 min before the avoidance training interferes with the amnesic effect of a second 5 min exposure to the open field 1 hr after avoidance training and restores the hippocampal levels of {pCREB.} In contrast, the avoidance training-associated activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (p42 and p44 mitogen-activated protein kinases) in the hippocampus is not altered by novelty. Together, these findings suggest that novelty regulates {LTM} formation by modulating the phosphorylation state of {CREB} in the hippocampus.},

Two of the experiments have been reported previously and are reviewed here, while the third experiment is presented here for the first time. The first experiment examined prenatal phenytoin (200 mg/kg), trimethadione (250 mg/kg), and phenobarbital (80 mg/kg) for critical period effects by exposing separate groups of rats to the drugs or to vehicle on embryonic (E) days 7-10, 11-14, or 15-18. Phenytoin produced effects in the E11-14 offspring, but few effects in the E15-18 offspring, and almost no effects in the E7-10 offspring. Phenytoin's E11-14 effects in the offspring were increased pivoting, delayed swimming ontogeny, hyperactivity, impaired water maze learning, and impaired passive avoidance retention. The second experiment looked for phenytoin's long-term effects. Phenytoin-exposed offspring administered 200 mg/kg on E7-18 exhibited numerous postnatal dysfunctions, including water maze learning deficits that persisted to beyond 501 days of age. The learning deficits were neither increased nor decreased in severity at this age compared to those seen in littermates tested at 50 days of age. The third experiment assessed the role of manganese in counteracting phenytoin-induced postnatal dysfunction and the possible confounding effects of maternal undernutrition associated with the drug's administration. The typical pattern of phenytoin-induced behavioral effects was observed in rat offspring. The results demonstrated that undernutrition was not a confound, since pair-feeding and pair-watering controls did not diminish the phenytoin-induced dysfunction in the offspring. Also, administration of a manganese supplementation (200 ppm in the drinking water) during gestation did not significantly alter the pattern of phenytoin-induced postnatal effects.},

To this end behavioral development was assessed using a developmental time scale which allowed comparison of the two studies. Pregnant {B6D2F1/J} mice were maintained on either a protein restricted or normal protein diet from Day 7 to Day 24 postconception, at which time the low protein group was returned to the normal diet until behavioral testing at Day 32. Behavioral development in the control group replicated the values obtained in previous studies, whereas the malnourished pups were retarded by 1.4 days. This was of the same order of magnitude as that reported previously for maternal inbreeding. Measures of maternal and pup body weight at birth, Day 24 and Day 32 indicated that although the malnourished animals were initially significantly lighter in weight they had recovered by Day 32. Litter size however, declined between birth and time of behavioral testing in the malnourished group. © 1983 Academic Press, Inc.},

In the first experiment we report changes in {LH}, prolactin ({PRL)} and {ACTH} secretion in food-restricted and ad-libitum fed lactating rats at various stages of lactation. Our results demonstrate that food restriction during the first 2 weeks of lactation did not affect {PRL} or {ACTH} secretion, but decreased plasma {LH} levels despite comparable {GnRH} receptor density between food-restricted and ad-libitum fed females. In the second experiments we investigated a possible causal relationship between the increased secretion of progesterone seen in food-restricted females and the suppression of plasma {LH} levels, by determining the effects of bromocriptine treatment and ovariectomy on {LH} secretion in both ad-libitum fed and food-restricted lactating females. {LH} suppression in food-restricted lactating females was not affected by ovariectomy or bromocriptine treatment, although the latter treatment significantly increased {GnRH} receptor number. These data suggest that factors other than ovarian steroids, {PRL} or increased adrenocortical activity modulate {LH} secretion and the length of lactational dioestrus in food-restricted lactating females.},

	abstract = {Rats were underfed from birth to determine the effects of chronic food deprivation on gonadal function. Pups were allowed to nurse for 12 h out of 24 until they were weaned. Thereafter, they received 50 percent of the daily amount of food consumed by controls. Besides being underfed, animals were also pinealectomized and/or maintained in constant light. Although delayed, vaginal opening occurred in all underfed groups. Two or three extended estrous cycles occurred after vaginal opening, then the animals became anestrus; however, cycling was restored when they were placed in constant light or with a male. Despite irregular estrous cycles in underfed females, they copulated, became pregnant and gave birth to litters of normal size and composition. Similarly, underfed males impregnated fed females. Continuous illumination or pinealectomy stimulated compensatory hypertrophy in the remaining ovary after hemiovariectomy both in rats underfed from birth and in starved adults which had achieved normal growth prior to underfeeding; however, the latter treatment was not as effective as the former. It did, however, increase ovarian weight prior to surgery. The adverse effects of underfeeding on reproductive function may be due to physiologic alteration resulting in a new pattern of control, rather than simply a reduced rate or lack of function due to less available energy, since the gonads may be stimulated to renewed activity by environmental or surgical manipulations.},

There were no significant differences among potoroine species in fasting metabolic rate. The lowest fasting heat production for each species was 11-20\% less than the interspecific value of 295 {kJ} · kg-0.75 · day-1 for basal metabolism of mature, non-reproductive eutherian homeotherms. The respiratory quotient of all species was reduced significantly as starvation proceeded, but only for B. penicillata was there a significant effect of starvation duration on fasting heat production. The night-time activity of P. tridactylus and B. penicillata doubled their daytime fasting heat production; the corresponding increase for A. rufescens was only 25\%. The calorimetric measurement of fed animals showed no differences in digestible energy or metabolisable energy between species. Nevertheless, P. tridactylus and B. penicillata produced more heat per unit metabolic body mass. The maintenance energy requirements ({kJ} · kg-0.75 · day-1) were 479, 494 and 345 for P. tridactylus, B. penicillata and A. rufescens, respectively. The net availability of metabolisable energy was about 0.70 in the three species. The combined heat production of fed female A. rufescens and their pouch young stayed relatively constant for the first two-thirds of pouch life, after which it rose sharply (20\%) in response to the rapid growth of the young. Only during the last week of pouch life did the female enter negative energy balance. There was no indication that the metabolism of the female increased in response to the presence of a pouch young. The presence of pouch young did not alter the efficiency of utilisation of metabolisable energy.

	abstract = {This study evaluated the role of stress-induced reductions in food intake in pregnant {B6D2F1} mice in the production of developmental abnormalities in the offspring. One group of dams underwent one hour of physical restraint stress twice daily from days 12 to 17 of gestation. A second group was not restrained but, during this period, each dam was pair-fed to a weight-matched partner in the stressed group. A third group was left undisturbed and allowed unlimited access to lab chow and water. The restraint stress procedure reduced the average daily food and water intake in the dams, resulting in lower maternal weights, with the unstressed pair-fed group being affected more severely than the stressed group. The offspring of both the stressed and pair-fed dams were lighter than the offspring of the dams fed ad lib on day 20 postconception, and exhibited lower brain weights on day 32 postconception. Neurobehavioral development, as assessed on a battery of sensorimotor tests on day 32 postconception, was retarded in the prenatally stressed pups in comparison to the ad lib pups, while the pair-fed pups did not differ from either group. There were no differences among any of the groups on day 50 body or brain weight, body or tail length, anogenital distance, or locomotion, rearing and defecation in the open field. These results suggest that reductions in maternal food intake account for at least some of the deficits commonly attributed to prenatal stress and that, when the stressing procedure is known to reduce food consumption, pair-fed control groups must be included before any interpretation of the nature of prenatal stress effects can be made.},

This study determined adult sensitivity to testosterone (T) in males prenatally exposed to alcohol, to stress, or to both factors. Sexually naive males were tested with receptive females following castration and implantation of 20-, 30-, or 45-mm Silastic T-filled capsules. Serum T levels provided by these implants were measured. The behavior shown by males exposed only to prenatal alcohol did not differ from untreated control animals at any T dosage. Prenatal stress alone diminished the copulatory potential below control levels only when the intermediate T dosage was provided. Few males exposed to both alcohol and stress copulated under the lowest or the intermediate dose of adult T replacement, but most ejaculated normally when the largest capsule was implanted. The threshold to the sexual behavior-activating-properties of adult T exposure was moderately raised by prenatal stress but was severely affected when prenatal stress was combined with alcohol. We conclude that a diminished sensitivity to androgen in adulthood underlies some copulatory deficits resulting from treatments that alter fetal T levels. Such deficits may be concealed when behavior is evaluated in gonadally intact animals.},

Three liquid diets were formulated ranging in protein content from suboptimal to supraoptimal (18\%, 25\%, or 32\% of total calories) in terms of pregnancy requirements, while ethanol was held constant at high levels (36\% of total calories). In addition to the alcohol group (A), both pair-fed ({PF)} and ad limitum-fed control (C) groups were included in each diet regimen. Basal levels of corticosterone and the adrenocortical response to stress were measured in dams on days 11, 16, or 21 of gestation. Plasma levels of corticosterone-binding globulin ({CBG)} were also measured on gestation days 16 and 21. Maternal adrenal weights, basal corticosterone levels, the adrenocortical response to stress, and the corticoid stress increment were all significantly increased in A compared to both {PF} and C females. Plasma {CBG} levels of A females were similar to or less than those of {PF} and C females. Thus alcohol consumption significantly increased maternal pituitary-adrenal activity as early as day 11 of gestation and these effects on hormonal function increased as gestation progressed.

After doses of benzquinamide that reliably disrupt avoidance behavior, concentrations of noradrenaline ({NA)} and serotonin (5-{HT)} in the brain are within normal limits, and overt sedative or parasympathetic symptoms do not occur. Moreover, benzquinamide is only mildly susceptible to antagonism by monoamine oxidase ({MAO)} inhibition. The high specificity of behavioral activity demonstrated by benzquinamide contrasts with the nonspecific effects of its parent alcohol : the alcohol is a potent depletor of brain {NA} and 5-{HT}, highly susceptible to reversal by an {MAO} inhibitor, and active in producing reserpine-like symptoms. The rapid and potent effect of benzquinamide on avoidance behavior leads to the conclusion that its avoidance-disrupting activity is mediated by a mechanism other than depletion of {NA} and 5-{HT} from the brain. © 1962.},

	abstract = {Background and aims: Low birth weight affects 1 in every 7 babies born globally and can predict a lifetime of increased risk for adverse health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Maternal low protein diet during pregnancy and lactation is a well-characterized rat model for low birth weight and the subsequent increase in chronic disease risk. However, mice have been relatively understudied in this paradigm and represent a critical resource for investigating the underlying molecular mechanisms that link adverse early life experience and the development of chronic disease. Methods and results: The present manuscript describes a mouse model of low birth weight (maternal consumption of low protein diet (8\% protein) through pregnancy and lactation) and characterizes metabolic adaptations (food intake, locomotor activity, oxygen consumption, and glucose tolerance) in male and female offspring. At weaning, mice were maintained either on the control diet or a high fat diet. Notable sex differences were observed, with male mice from the low protein pregnancies showing increased food intake, hyperactivity and increased metabolic rate only when weaned to the high fat diet, while female mice consistently showed increased food intake and were hypometabolic, regardless of post-weaning diet. Conclusion: These data identify offspring sex and post-weaning diet as critical variables in the metabolic adaptations to early life protein deficiency, and suggest that females may be more vulnerable to the adverse long-term health consequences of low birth weight (C) 2011 Elsevier {B.V.} All rights reserved.},

This study represents a further, systematic investigation of the role of {CB1} cannabinoid receptors in the pharmacological effects of cannabinoids on food intake. 2 Mice were food-restricted for 24 h and then allowed access to their regular rodent chow for 1 h. Whereas the {CB1} antagonist {SR141716A} dose-dependently decreased food consumption at doses that did not affect motor activity, Delta(9)- tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(9)-{THC)} increased food consumption at doses that had no effect on motor activity. O-3259 and O-3257, structural analogs of {SR141716A}, produced effects similar to those of the parent compound. 3 Amphetamine ( a known anorectic) and diazepam ( a benzodiazepine and {CNS} depressant) decreased food consumption, but only at doses that also increased or decreased motor activity, respectively. The {CB2} cannabinoid receptor antagonist {SR144528} and the nonpsychoactive cannabinoid cannabidiol did not affect food intake nor activity. 4 {SR141716A} decreased feeding in wild-type mice, but lacked pharmacological activity in {CB1} knockout mice; however, basal food intake was lower in {CB1} knockout mice. Amphetamine decreased feeding in both mouse genotypes. 5 These results suggest that {SR141716A} may affect the actions of endogenous cannabinoids in regulating appetite or that it may have effects of its own asidefrom antagonism of cannabinoid effects ( e. g., decreased feeding behavior and locomotor stimulation). In either case, these results strongly suggest that {CB1} receptors may play a role in regulation of feeding behavior.},

Offspring of {COC} Late, {SPF} 20, and {SPF} 10 dams demonstrated brain and body growth retardation on P1 when compared to pups born to {SAL} dams. Pups from all groups were tested for first-order Pavlovian conditioning on P9, or for the ability to ignore redundant information in a blocking paradigm on P50. Only {COC} 40 mice (i.e., offspring born to {COC} 40 dams) were unable to acquire an aversion to an odor previously paired with shock on P9. When compared with {SAL} controls, {COC} 40 mice (and to a less significant extent {SPF} 40 mice) demonstrated a persistent behavioral deficit in the blocking paradigm on P50, which may reflect alterations in selective attention. Correlation analyses indicated that the dose and gestational timing of transplacental cocaine exposure, and varying degrees of malnutrition, had effects on blocking performance, with greater prenatal cocaine exposure and increased prenatal malnutrition resulting in more significant behavioral impairments. A path regression analysis demonstrated independent and significant effects of prenatal cocaine as well as prenatal malnutrition in contributing to impaired performance in the blocking paradigm. As suggested by the clinical literature, our preclinical data support a model whereby the dose and duration of prenatal cocaine exposure have direct effects on offspring brain and body growth and on behavioral performance.},

Animals were artificially reared from postnatal day ({PND)} 4-9 with drug concentrated in four daily feeds. There were four treatment groups, 40 mg/kg/day cocaine, 20 mg/kg/day cocaine, an artificially reared control and a surgery control. From {PND} 38-42, subjects were tested with a food reward ({EXP} 1) or a play reward ({EXP} 2). No deficits in learning were seen when the reward was food. The 20 mg/kg/day cocaine group, however, showed impaired learning and altered play behavior when the reward was access to a play partner. Neonatal cocaine exposure thus appears to differentially affect learning based on the type of reward presented. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.},

	volume = {147},
	abstract = {Methamphetamine ({MA)} is a commonly abused stimulant and because of its addictive properties, abusers may not cease use during pregnancy, thereby exposing the fetus to the drug. The consequences of such exposure remain largely unknown however data from animal models show that long-term deficits in spatial learning and memory in the Morris water maze ({MWM)} occur. In this study we explored the spatial learning ability of rats treated four times daily with {MA} (5 mg/kg/dose) during the sensitive period for induction of {MWM} deficits, postnatal days (P) 11-20, using a different maze. In adulthood the animals were tested in a non-swimming spatial task, the Barnes maze, using either aversive (bright light) or appetitive (food reward) motivation. Approximately 30 days after behavioral testing, the pituitary and adrenal response to forced swim was assessed and susceptibility to {MA-induced} neurotoxicity measured. {MA-treated} animals tested in the aversive, but not the appetitive, version of the Barnes maze demonstrated spatial learning deficits. An attenuated corticosterone response in {MA-treated} animals was observed following forced swimming, however no differences in {ACTH} were found. Following acute {MA} administration in adulthood to all animals, the neonatally {MA-treated} animals displayed longer latencies to fall from a cliff than neonatally saline-treated rats given the same acute {MA} dose. This effect supports previous data showing hypoactivity in neonatally {MA-treated} animals. Acute {MA} treatment caused comparable striatal monoamine depletions in all group, although females treated with {MA} as neonates displayed increased basal levels of corticosterone three days after the acute dose. These data demonstrate that {MA} administration during the neonatal period impairs spatial learning in an aversive non-swimming task and alters the adrenal response to a forced swim stressor, suggesting that the adrenal output during learning may contribute to the spatial learning deficits.

	volume = {1039},
	abstract = {We have previously shown that ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine ({MDMA)} treatment from P11 to P20 in rats produces deficits in cognitive ability when these animals are tested in adulthood. The purpose of this experiment was to explore the neuroendocrine and neurochemical changes produced by {MDMA} treatment on P11. We examined monoamines in the hippocampus and striatum and the serotonin transporter in the hippocampus as well as pituitary and adrenal output following administration of {MDMA} (10 mg/kg, 4 times) on postnatal day 11. Significant depletions in serotonin were evident in the hippocampus 1 h and in the striatum 24 h after the first dose and remained reduced 78 h later. No changes in serotonin transporter were observed following {MDMA} treatment, although females had lower levels than males. No changes in dopamine were detected. The metabolites of serotonin and dopamine had different profiles than the parent compounds after {MDMA} administration. Plasmatic {ACTH} was elevated immediately following {MDMA} and remained elevated for at least 1 h after the last dose and returned to baseline by 24 h. Corticosterone was increased after the first dose and remained increased for at least 24 h, and returned to baseline by 30 h. The decreases in serotonin in regions important for learning and memory in conjunction with elevated levels of corticosterone during a period of stress hyporesponsiveness suggest that these initial responses to {MDMA} may contribute to the long-term learning and memory deficits following neonatal {MDMA} exposure. © 2005 Elsevier {B.V.} All rights reserved.},

	volume = {6},
	abstract = {Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a strong genetic component. Core symptoms are abnormal reciprocal social interactions, qualitative impairments in communication, and repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior with restricted interests. Candidate genes for autism include the {SHANK} gene family, as mutations in {SHANK2} and {SHANK3} have been detected in several autistic individuals. {SHANK} genes code for a family of scaffolding proteins located in the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses. To test the hypothesis that a mutation in {SHANK1} contributes to the symptoms of autism, we evaluated Shank1 -/- null mutant mice for behavioral phenotypes with relevance to autism, focusing on social communication. Ultrasonic vocalizations and the deposition of scent marks appear to be two major modes of mouse communication. Our findings revealed evidence for low levels of ultrasonic vocalizations and scent marks in Shank1 -/- mice as compared to wildtype Shank1 +/+ littermate controls. Shank1 -/- pups emitted fewer vocalizations than Shank1 +/+ pups when isolated from mother and littermates. In adulthood, genotype affected scent marking behavior in the presence of female urinary pheromones. Adult Shank1 -/- males deposited fewer scent marks in proximity to female urine than Shank1 +/+ males. Call emission in response to female urinary pheromones also differed between genotypes. Shank1 +/+ mice changed their calling pattern dependent on previous female interactions, while Shank1 -/- mice were unaffected, indicating a failure of Shank1 -/- males to learn from a social experience. The reduced levels of ultrasonic vocalizations and scent marking behavior in Shank1 -/- mice are consistent with a phenotype relevant to social communication deficits in autism.},

We have hypothesized that adolescence represents a sensitive period for the development of some aspects of adult stress response regulation. This was based on prior work showing that repeated exposure of rats to a stressor across an adolescent period increases fearfulness in a novel environment in adulthood and results in lower levels of dopamine receptor subtype-2 protein in prefrontal cortex. Here, we further our investigation of both acute and long-term effects of repeated adolescent stressor exposure on physiological (i.e., corticosterone) and behavioral (i.e., defensive behavior) measures of stress responding in male and female rats. Furthermore, we compared outcomes with those following identical manipulations administered in early adulthood and found that animals exposed to cues of predation threat during adolescence showed the most robust defensive responses to a homotypic stressor encountered in adulthood. Peer interaction during control manipulation in adolescence was identified as an important individual characteristic mediating development of adult defensive strategies.

Body weight of {DR} mice was reduced relative to control except that of females in the 20\% {DR} group (no difference as compared with control group). Learning and memory retention test in a Y maze demonstrated that {DR} increased learning, but not retention, in male mice, whereas neither learning nor retention was affected in females. The open-field test revealed no difference in exploratory activity in all groups. Reproductive assessment showed that 35\% {DR} retarded the maturation of reproductive function and reduced fertility compared with other groups. Furthermore, both 20\% and 35\% {DR} led to a lower level of sperm motility and a higher level of abnormal sperm relative to control mice. These findings indicate that {DR} does not cause damaging effects on growth and neurobehavior, but imposes a risk to reproductive development events.},

We investigated the potential effects of three levels of Pb exposure (low, middle, and high Pb: 0.03\%, 0.09\%, and 0.27\% of lead acetate-containing diets) at the gestational period on the spatial memory of young adult offspring by Morris water maze spatial learning and fixed location/visible platform tasks. Our results revealed that three levels of Pb exposure significantly impaired memory retrieval in male offspring, but only female offspring at low levels of Pb exposure showed impairment of memory retrieval. These impairments were not due to the gross disturbances in motor performance and in vision because these animals performed the fixed location/visible platform task as well as controls, indicating that the specific aspects of spatial learning/memory were impaired. These results suggest that exposure to Pb during the gestational period is sufficient to cause long-term learning/memory deficits in young adult offspring. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Prenatal exposure of mice to heroin ({SC} injection of 10 mg/kg to the dams on gestational days 9-18) resulted at adulthood in behavioral deficits related to septohippocampal cholinergic innervation accompanied with both presynaptic and postsynaptic cholinergic hyperactivity; including an increase membrane {PKC} activity, and a desensitization of {PKC} to cholinergic input which were highly correlated with the behavioral performance and were reversed by cholinergic grafting. Therefore, we studied the receptor induced activation of the behaviorally relevant {PKCgamma} and {PKCbetaII} isoforms and the less behaviorally relevant {PKCalpha} isoform. Time course studies revealed peak translocation after 40 min incubation with carbachol for {PKCgamma} (110\% increase from basal, i.e. no carbachol level, P {\textless} 0.01), 30 min for phosphorylated {PKCbetaII} (130\%, P {\textless} 0.05) and 5 min for non-phosphorylated {PKCbetaII} (64\%, P {\textless} 0.05) with no peak for alpha. Prenatal heroin abolished the translocation of {PKCgamma} and {PKCbetaII} while {PKCalpha} remained unaffected. A decrease occurred in basal phosphorylated membrane (-45\%, P {\textless} 0.01) and cytosol-associated (-29\%, P {\textless} 0.01) {PKCbetaII}, in membrane-associated non-phosphorylated {PKCbetaII} (-32\%, P {\textless} 0.01) and {PKCgamma} (-25\%, P {\textless} 0.01) and in cytosolic {PKCalpha} (-27\%, P {\textless} 0.01), while membrane-associated {PKCalpha} was slightly increased (11\%, P {\textless} 0.05). The results suggest that prenatal heroin disrupts cholinergic receptor induced {PKC} translocation and activation with the underlying mechanism of neuroteratogenicity potentially lying in the {PKOgamma} and {PKCbetaII}, while {PKCalpha} remains unaffected.

Following i.v. administration in rats ( dose range 0.32 - 1.848 mg), the time course of the concentration in plasma was determined in conjunction with the effect in ventilation as determined with a novel whole- body plethysmography technique. The {PK} of norbuprenorphine was best described by a three- compartment {PK} model with nonlinear elimination. A saturable biophase distribution model with a power {PD} model described the {PK-} {PD} relationship best. No saturation of the effect at high concentrations was observed, indicating that norbuprenorphine acts as a full agonist with regard to respiratory depression. Moreover, analysis of the hysteresis based on the combined receptor association- dissociation biophase distribution model yielded high values of the rate constants for receptor association and dissociation, indicating that these processes are not rate- limiting. In a separate analysis, the time course of the plasma concentrations of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine following administration of both the parent drug and the metabolite were simultaneously analyzed based on a six- compartment {PK} model with nonlinear elimination of norbuprenorphine. This analysis showed that following i. v. administration, 10\% of the administered dose of buprenorphine is converted into norbuprenorphine. By simulation it is shown that following i. v. administration of buprenorphine, the concentrations of norbuprenorphine reach values that are well below the values causing an effect on respiration.},

Here we show that R-type {VSCCs} in spines of rat {CA1} pyramidal neurons are depressed for at least 30 min after brief trains of back-propagating action potentials. Populations of channels in single spines are depressed stochastically and synchronously, independent of channels in the parent dendrite and other spines, implying that depression is the result of signaling restricted to individual spines. Induction of {VSCC} depression blocks theta-burst-induced long-term potentiation ({LTP)}, indicating that postsynaptic action potentials can modulate synaptic plasticity by tuning {VSCCs.} Induction of depression requires [Ca2+] elevations and activation of L-type {VSCCs}, which activate Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase {II} ({CaMKII)} and a cyclic adenosine monophosphate ({cAMP)-dependent} pathway. Given that L-type {VSCCs} do not contribute measurably to Ca2+ influx in spines, they must activate downstream effectors either directly through voltage-dependent conformational changes or via [Ca2+] microdomains.},

The remaining dams were continuously fed their respective diets until the birth of their pups. Upon delivery, newborn pups from the dams fed a 20\%, 12\%, or 6\% protein diet with caffeine were placed with foster darns that the dietary regimen during gestation was a 20\%, 12\%, or 6\% protein diet, respectively.

On day 15, both nondeprived and deprived newborn rats were studied. Caffeine in combination with a malnourished diet has different effects on general activity in prenatal stages compared to postnatal stages. Our findings support the view that prenatal exposure to caffeine may produce greater effects because: a) caffeine and its metabolites pass freely into the embryo and attain a concentration slightly lower than in the maternal plasma; and b) caffeine may be poorly metabolized during pregnancy, causing an accumulation in the fetal tissues. Prenatal caffeine at the dosage we have used in combination with malnutrition may produce lasting metabolic alterations in the nervous system related to the emergence of suckling behavior and general motor activity.},

	volume = {56},
	abstract = {Six groups of pregnant dams were fed a 20\%, 12\%, and 6\% protein diet with and without caffeine (2 mg/100 g b.wt.), starting on day 7 of gestation. At day 18 of gestation, randomly selected dams of each group were used to record prenatal fetal behavior. The remaining dams were continuously fed their respective diets until the birth of their pups. Upon delivery, newborn pups from the dams fed a 20\%, 12\%, or 6\% protein diet with caffeine were placed with foster dams that the dietary regimen during gestation was a 20\%, 12\%, or 6\% protein diet, respectively. Dams fed a noncaffeine diet, along with their newborns, were fed their respective diets until day 15. Suckling behavior tests for newborns were conducted on days 2, 8, and 15. On day 15, both nondeprived and deprived newborn rats were studied. Caffeine in combination with a malnourished diet has different effects on general activity in prenatal stages compared to postnatal stages. Our findings support the view that prenatal exposure to caffeine may produce greater effects because: a) caffeine and its metabolites pass freely into the embryo and attain a concentration slightly lower than in the maternal plasma; and b) caffeine may be poorly metabolized during pregnancy, causing an accumulation in the fetal tissues. Prenatal caffeine at the dosage we have used in combination with malnutrition may produce lasting metabolic alterations in the nervous system related to the emergence of suckling behavior and general motor activity.},

We, therefore, carried out studies in rats utilizing techniques of norepinephrine turnover to assess thyroid sympathetic activity in vivo. Thyroidal sympathetic activity was increased 95\% by exposure to cold (4 degrees C), 42\% by chronic ingestion of an iodine-deficient diet, and 32\% in rats fed a goitrogenic diet (low-iodine diet supplemented with propylthiouracil). In addition, fasting for 2 days reduced sympathetic nervous system activity in thyroid by 38\%. Thyroid growth and I-125 uptake were also compared in intact and decentralized hemithyroids obtained from animals subjected to unilateral superior cervical ganglion decentralization. Unilateral superior cervical ganglion decentralization led to a reduction in thyroid weight, in I-125 uptake by thyroid tissue, and in {TSH-induced} stimulation of I-125 uptake in decentralized hemithyroids. These results suggest that sympathetic activity in thyroid contributes to gland enlargement and may modulate tissue responsiveness to {TSH.}},

	volume = {64},
	abstract = {The pattern of urinary catecholamine excretion in fasting differs in pregnant and nonpregnant rats, which suggests that the sympathoadrenal response to fasting is altered by pregnancy. In fasting nonpregnant animals, urinary norepinephrine ({NE)} excretion decreases and epinephrine (E) excretion remains unchanged, whereas the excretion of both catecholamines rises significantly with refeeding. In contrast, fasting third-trimester pregnant rats exhibit a 420\% increase in urinary E and a 345\% increase in urinary {NE}, elevations which fall with refeeding. Specific evaluation of sympathoadrenal activity in fasting pregnant rats reveals stimulation of the adrenal medulla and suppression of sympathetic nerves. In fasting third-trimester rats the adrenal content of E is 37\% lower in innervated adrenals as compared with contralateral denervated glands, which indicates the presence of neurally-mediated adrenal medullary activation. Adrenalectomy completely abolishes the fasting-induced rise in urinary E and {NE} in pregnant rats. Studies with 2-deoxy-D-glucose suggest that stimulation of the adrenal medulla results from hypoglycemia, which is present after 3 d of fasting in pregnant rats (plasma glucose 36.7 mg/dl). Sympathetic nervous system activity, as measured by [ {3H]NE} turnover in the heart, decreases in fasting pregnant rats despite hypoglycemia, a response similar to that seen in fasting nonpregnant animals where plasma glucose in maintained above 50 mg/dl. The calculated {NE} turnover rate is 44\% lower in 2-d fasted pregnant rats than in fed pregnant animals (17.6 ± 1.3 vs. 31.3 ± 1.8 ng {NE/heart} per h, respectively). Thus adrenal medullary and sympathetic nervous system responses in fasting pregnant rats appear to be dissociated, which suggests that diet-induced changes in sympathetic activity and stimulation of the adrenal medulla by hypoglycemia may be independently regulated.},

Furthermore, with 1-min etherization, {GAP} (1.6 x 10-10 and 8.0 x 10-10 mol) reduced the stress-induced rise of plasma {PRL}, but had no effect on the stress-induced decline of plasma gonadotropin levels in male rats. A single iv injection of {GAP} (8.0 x 10-10 mol) into lactating rats before the onset of nursing did not block the elevation of plasma {PRL} induced by suckling.

These results indicate that the activity of {GAP} to stimulate {FSH} and {LH} release is limited, since {GAP} stimulated the release of {FSH} and {LH} only when plasma gonadotropin levels were extremely low. However, the in vivo evidence that {GAP} inhibited {PRL} release in a variety of conditions reinforces the possibility that {GAP} could be the peptidic {PRL-inhibiting} factor.},

Methods: One-day pregnant rats were randomly divided into four groups (n = 12): control ({CO)}, pair-fed ({PF)}, zinc-deprived ({ZD)}, and oral zinc-supplemented ({OZS).} The {CO} and {PF} groups were fed a control diet (zinc 25 mu g/g diet), and the others were fed a mildly zinc-deficient diet (zinc mu g/g diet) during pregnancy and lactation. After weaning (day 21), offspring in the {OZS} group were switched to a control diet. After 35 d, the behavioral function of the offspring was tested with the Morris water maze test. The ultrastructure of the hippocampal {CA3} area was observed under a transmission electron microscope. Results: Compared with the {CO} and {PF} groups, rats in the {ZD} group spent more time finding the latent platform and swam longer distances (P {\textless} 0.05). The time used finding the platform and the swimming distance in the {OZS} group were similar to those in the {CO} and {PF} groups (P {\textgreater} 0.05). In addition, apoptotic neuronal changes in the hippocampus were observed in the {ZD} group, whereas the reversal of neuronal morphologic changes was observed in the {OZS} group. Conclusion: The changes in hippocampal neuron morphology were consistent with the changes in the learning and memory ability of mildly zinc-deficient and zinc-supplemented offspring.

Delayed morphological development and reduced absorptive activity of the intestine may contribute to the effects described or to the high mortality rate. In vitro synthesis of growth hormone was significantly decreased in pituitaries of young of protein deficient dams. Exogenous growth hormone increased epiphyseal width, tibial length and body weight in these pups. Thyroxin corrected the delay in ossification without affecting body weight.

Fat mass ({FM)}, fat-free mass ({FFM)}, food intake ({FI)}, resting metabolic rate ({RMR)}, physical activity ({PA)}, and body temperature (T b) were all evaluated at baseline in 60 mice (aged 10-12 weeks) before {HFD} feeding.

We examined these constraints at peak lactation in {MF1} mice that had ad libitum access to food, or that had to run a pre-set target on running wheels to obtain ad libitum access to food. The voluntary distance run decreased sharply during pregnancy and peak lactation. When lactating females were provided with 80\% of their estimated food requirements, and had to run pre-set distances of 2, 4 or 6 km before given access to additional ad libitum food, most of them did not complete the running target during late lactation and the mice with the highest targets failed to reach their targets earlier in lactation. There were consequently significant group differences in asymptotic food intake (2 km, 16.97±0.40gday-1; 4km, 14.29±0. 72gday-1; and 6 km, 12.65±0.45gday-1) and weaned litter masses (2km, 71.11±2.39 g; 4km, 54.63±4.28g and 6km, 47.18±2.46g). When the females did run sufficiently to gain ad libitum food access, their intake did not differ between the different distance groups or from controls that were not required to run. Thus, despite being physically capable of running the distances, mice could not exercise sufficiently in lactation to gain regular ad libitum access to food, probably because of the risks of hyperthermia when combining heat production from exercise with thermogenesis from lactation. © 2013.

	volume = {216},
	abstract = {Limits to sustained energy intake ({SusEI)} during lactation in Swiss mice have been suggested to reflect the secretory capacity of the mammary glands. However, an alternative explanation is that milk production and food intake are regulated to match the limited growth capacity of the offspring. In the present study, female Swiss mice were experimentally manipulated in two ways - litter sizes were adjusted to be between 1 and 9 pups and mice were exposed to either warm ({21°C)} or cold ({5°C)} conditions from day 10 of lactation. Energy intake, number of pups and litter mass, milk energy output ({MEO)}, thermogenesis, mass of the mammary glands and brown adipose tissue cytochrome c oxidase activity of the mothers were measured. At 21 and {5°C}, pup mass at weaning was almost independent of litter size. Positive correlations were observed between the number of pups, litter mass, asymptotic food intake and {MEO.} These data were consistent with the suggestion that in small litters, pup requirements may be the major factor limiting milk production. Pups raised at {5°C} had significantly lower body masses than those raised at {21°C.} This was despite the fact that milk production and energy intake at the same litter sizes were both substantially higher in females raising pups at {5°C.} This suggests that pup growth capacity is lower in the cold, perhaps due to pups allocating ingested energy to fuel thermogenesis. Differences in observed levels of milk production under different conditions may then reflect a complex interplay between factors limiting maternal performance (peripheral limitation and heat dissipation: generally better when it is cooler) and factors influencing maximum pup growth (litter size and temperature: generally better when it is hotter), and may together result in an optimal temperature favouring reproduction. © 2013.

	volume = {213},
	abstract = {The limitation on sustainable energy intake ({SusEI)} is important because it establishes the upper energetic limit on the ability of animals to disperse, survive and reproduce. However, there are still arguments about what factors impose that limitation. Thermoregulation in cold environments imposes great energy demands on small mammals. A cold-exposed animal has been suggested to be a model suitable for testing these factors. Here, we examined the changes in food intake and digestible energy intake ({DEI)} as measures of {SusEI}, thermogenic capacity and behavioral patterns in Swiss mice exposed to consecutively lower ambient temperatures from 23 to -15 degrees C. Cold-exposed mice showed significant decreases in body mass, fat content of the carcass and body temperature, and increases in {DEI} compared with controls. The time spent on feeding significantly increased with decreasing temperatures, and time spent on general activity decreased following cold exposure. Resting metabolic rate, nonshivering thermogenesis and serum tri-iodothyronine levels significantly increased in mice exposed to lower temperatures in comparison with controls, whereas these thermogenic variables were not significantly different between 0 and -15 degrees C. It might suggest that {SusEI} in cold exposed Swiss mice was constrained peripherally by the capacity to produce heat and also by the ability to dissipate body heat, but to a different extent. Moderate cold exposure might result in a relaxation of the heat dissipation limit ({HDL)}, allowing the animals to increase food intake to meet cold stress. When animals are exposed to severe cold, the thermogenenic capacity might reach a ceiling, failing to compensate for the heat loss and which would finally result in lower body temperature and considerable weight loss. This might indicate that the {HDL} was set at a higher level than peripheral limits for Swiss mice exposed to a consecutive decrease in ambient temperatures.},

We examined these constraints at peak lactation in {MF1} mice that had ad libitum access to food, or that had to run a pre-set target on running wheels to obtain ad libitum access to food. The voluntary distance run decreased sharply during pregnancy and peak lactation. When lactating females were provided with 80\% of their estimated food requirements, and had to run pre-set distances of 2, 4 or 6. km before given access to additional ad libitum food, most of them did not complete the running target during late lactation and the mice with the highest targets failed to reach their targets earlier in lactation. There were consequently significant group differences in asymptotic food intake (2 km, 16.97 +/- 0.40 g day(-1); 4 km, 14.29 +/- 0.72 g day(-1); and 6 km, 12.65 +/- 0.45 g day(-1)) and weaned litter masses (2 km, 71.11 +/- 2.39 g; 4 km, 54.63 +/- 4.28 g and 6 km, 47.18 +/- 2.46 g). When the females did run sufficiently to gain ad libitum food access, their intake did not differ between the different distance groups or from controls that were not required to run. Thus, despite being physically capable of running the distances, mice could not exercise sufficiently in lactation to gain regular ad libitum access to food, probably because of the risks of hyperthermia when combining heat production from exercise with thermogenesis from lactation.},

	volume = {216},
	abstract = {Limits to sustained energy intake ({SusEI)} during lactation in Swiss mice have been suggested to reflect the secretory capacity of the mammary glands. However, an alternative explanation is that milk production and food intake are regulated to match the limited growth capacity of the offspring. In the present study, female Swiss mice were experimentally manipulated in two ways litter sizes were adjusted to be between 1 and 9 pups and mice were exposed to either warm (21 degrees C) or cold (5 degrees C) conditions from day 10 of lactation. Energy intake, number of pups and litter mass, milk energy output ({MEO)}, thermogenesis, mass of the mammary glands and brown adipose tissue cytochrome c oxidase activity of the mothers were measured. At 21 and 5 C, pup mass at weaning was almost independent of litter size. Positive correlations were observed between the number of pups, litter mass, asymptotic food intake and {MEO.} These data were consistent with the suggestion that in small litters, pup requirements may be the major factor limiting milk production. Pups raised at 5 C had significantly lower body masses than those raised at 21 C. This was despite the fact that milk production and energy intake at the same litter sizes were both substantially higher in females raising pups at 5 C. This suggests that pup growth capacity is lower in the cold, perhaps due to pups allocating ingested energy to fuel thermogenesis. Differences in observed levels of milk production under different conditions may then reflect a complex interplay between factors limiting maternal performance (peripheral limitation and heat dissipation: generally better when it is cooler) and factors influencing maximum pup growth (litter size and temperature: generally better when it is hotter), and may together result in an optimal temperature favouring reproduction.},

	abstract = {Objective: To test the hypothesis that maternal restriction of polyphenol-rich foods ({PRF)}, which, like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ({NSAID)}, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis in the third trimester, reverse fetal ductal constriction ({DC).} Study Design: An open clinical trial of 51 third trimester fetuses with {DC} with no history of {NSAID} intake was designed. All mothers were submitted to a food frequency questionnaire and were oriented to withdrawl {PRF}, being reassessed after 3 weeks. Doppler parameters were assessed before and after discontinuation of these substances. A control group of 26 third trimester normal fetuses, with no ductus arteriosus ({DA)} constriction, in which no dietary intervention was offered, was reviewed after 3 weeks. Student's t-test and Wilcoxon's test were used. Result: Mean gestational age was 32 +/- 3 weeks (28 to 37 weeks). After discontinuation of {PRF} ({\textgreater}= 3 weeks), 48/51 fetuses (96\%) showed complete reversal of {DC}, with decrease in mean ductal systolic velocity (1.74 +/- 0.20 ms(-1) to 1.31 +/- 0.34 ms(-1), P {\textless} 0.001), mean diastolic velocity (0.33 +/- 0.09 ms(-1) to 0.21 +/- 0.07 ms(-1), P {\textless} 0.001) and mean right to left ventricular dimension ratio (1.37 +/- 0.26 to 1.12 +/- 0.17, P {\textless} 0.001) and increase in mean ductal pulsatility index ({PI)} (1.98 +/- 0.36 to 2.46 +/- 0.23, P {\textless} 0.001). Median daily maternal consumption of {PRF} was 286 mg per day and decreased after orientation to 0mg per day, P {\textless} 0.001. In the control group, with {GA} of 32 +/- 4 w (29-37 w), there was no significant differences in median daily maternal consumption of {PRF}, mean ductal systolic velocitiy, diastolic velocity, {PI} and right ventricular to left ventricular diameter ratio ({RV/LV)} ratio. Conclusion: Reduction of maternal {PRF} intake during pregnancy, especially in the third trimester, is followed by complete reversal of {DC} (wide open {DA)}, which may influence maternal dietary habits in late pregnancy.

	volume = {73},
	abstract = {Some of the behavioral deficits caused by prenatal or postnatal alcohol exposure have been demonstrated to be ameliorated by environmental manipulations such as handling or environmental enrichment. This experiment, in contrast, investigated whether behavioral deficits due to prenatal alcohol exposure could be exacerbated by a stressful experience, early weaning. Pregnant dams were given either a liquid diet with 35\% of the calories derived from alcohol, a liquid diet without alcohol to control for any effects of the liquid diet administration, or ad libitum food and water. Half of each litter were weaned at 15 days of age (early weaning) and half were weaned at 21 days of age (normally weaned). Offspring were weighed, tested for activity in an open field at 18 days of age, and trained to find a hidden platform in the Morris water maze at 22-24 days of age. Alcohol-exposed subjects who were weaned early were more impaired in spatial navigation ability than any other group. Similarly, the combination of early weaning and prenatal alcohol exposure caused the slowest growth. All subjects exposed to alcohol, regardless of weaning condition, had greater latencies to find the platform than those from the two control groups. There was no synergistic effect of alcohol and stress on activity levels, but all early-weaned females were more active than normally weaned females; males did not show this effect. Thus, environmental stressors such as early weaning can compound detrimental symptoms of prenatal alcohol exposure. These results have implications for the understanding of the effects of the environment on neuronal plasticity. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},
